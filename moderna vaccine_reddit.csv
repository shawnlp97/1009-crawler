"Also, I had to drive two hours away to a Walmart pharmacy in a very rural area in the middle of my state where about half the people in the store weren't wearing masks. That was a real shocker."
"But mostly, I got tired of fending off the questions from every single person in my family, as well as my OB-GYN, as well as the people at the pharmacy, who all acted so surprised when I said I wanted to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Even the pharmacist basically interrogated me at the last minute and said, ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" And I said something politely along the lines of, ""YES. GIVE ME THE DAMN VACCINE."" They act like I'm drinking a shot of plutonium, for crying out loud."
"(My OB was not necessarily discouraging me so much, as she was very clearly worried about liability and kept repeating, ""I am neither discouraging nor encouraging you to get the vaccine. That's up to you."" Followed by repetitions that there is no data about its effects pregnancy, which is not exactly true.)"
"I said to my husband that even if I did get a bad reaction to the vaccine--even if I did miscarry as a result of it--that I come from the school of philosophy which says the mother's life is still more important. My new mantra is, ""My life matters too. It matters just as much if not more than this unborn baby's."" What I've learned is that I'm in a part of the country (in the US) where this is somehow a controversial belief."
"(It should go without saying that I care about my baby's life, a lot. But you know what my baby wouldn't like? If I got COVID-19 and had to be intubated.)"
"The pharmacist even warned me, ""You might get a fever from the vaccine. We normally discourage that during pregnancy."""
"To which I said, ""I would rather get a fever from the vaccine than from the live virus."""
"She just sort of looked at me blankly and said, ""Well, I suppose that's true."""
"So, this post is to vent, but it's also to lend support to all you pregnant mamas who are in the same boat. Don't let people shame you into thinking you're doing a dumb or reckless thing by getting the vaccine. Remember, your life matters too. And if you're not ready? That's also your choice. Do your research, follow your gut, and don't let anybody make you feel bad when you make your decision."
"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists sees no reason to deny the vaccine from pregnant women - meaning, they see no significant safety issue with vaccinating pregnant women. Before COVID, women have been recommended to other vaccines - the COVID vaccine is really no different other than it's an innovative mechanism. There's no reason to suspect that the COVID vaccine with pose a danger/risk any different than the other vaccines recommended for expecting moms."
But there has been quite a bit of reason to prevent COVID in pregnant women - it can cause more severe illness for the mother. So if it's about safety - it is logically more safe to deal with any side effects from the vaccine than getting COVID.
"I work in a hospital and review charts. I've seen several women come in with COVID, go into respiratory failure, get placed on a ventilator, and the baby had to be delivered while the mother was critically ill. I would take the sore arm, fever, and nausea I got from my vaccine over that scenario 100x over."
My aunt is an OB and was sharing these stories early on to try to inspire the nuttier parts of our family to be careful. And then I had a personal friend have to deliver pre-term to get intubated. She passed away on the vent (after coding and being revived multiple times). She never met her daughter. It's seriously the most soul crushing thing I can imagine.
This is such an awful story. Oh my goodness. It makes me so sad and angry at the same time. I'm sorry for your loss. :(
Thanks for sharing this.
"Honestly, the person who surprised me most of all was my OB-GYN. She seemed to sort of like the idea of me getting vaccinated when we discussed it in person, but when I messaged her nurse to get a doctor's note (to bring with me the vaccine appointment; in case I had to show proof of my condition to meet the state requirements) she came back with this strange noncommittal response."
"To be told by the pharmacist to basically ""think twice"" about the vaccine right before getting jabbed while surrounded by people in a rural Walmart not wearing masks was a surreal experience for sure."
"Oh my god, that is so sad. I am sorry. That is just awful."
"Honestly that was the response I was expecting from my OB when I first asked her at my first appointment. I‚Äôm an RN, and my hospital was offering it in December, right when I found out I was pregnant. I waited until I could ask my ob at my first appt in mid January, and was expecting her to tell me ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs your choice...‚Äù. I was SHOCKED (and thrilled) when she was adamantly for me getting it, given my exposure risk as a nurse, and increased risk factors with asthma and now pregnancy. I got my first dose at 9 weeks, and second at 12 weeks. Other than some arm soreness and dizziness after the second dose, i felt totally normal!"
"Congrats on your vaccination! Personally, it has made me feel so much more calm and confident during these crazy times to know I‚Äôve done the most I can to protect myself and baby."
How long did the dizziness last and when did it start after getting the 2nd dose?
"I haven't heard of that side effect and had to schedule my first dose about an hour away. I'm hopeful that I can get the second dose closer, but may bring my husband with me for the second one in case I feel yucky."
"I‚Äôm not the person you replied to, but I had flu-like symptoms beginning 12 hours post second dose, and they lasted 24 hours. Right after the shot I felt fine except for a sore arm, then the day after the shot I felt like crap, but I felt completely fine two days after."
"I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre probably fine to drive yourself home after the shot, but be prepared that you may feel sick the next day."
"The dizziness didn‚Äôt start for me until 24 hours later, and honestly for me it was a game of, ‚Äúis this pregnancy? Is this a vaccine side effect? Is this a night shift/caffeine headache?‚Äù Lol. It wasn‚Äôt severe, and I managed it with some Gatorade and a nap. Didn‚Äôt help I also renewed my CPR that same morning üòè"
I hope yours goes well and you don‚Äôt have any side effects!
"I was not pregnant, but had to drive 3 hours with a newborn to get vaccinated- I was super worried but my cohort all reported feeling fine until 8-12 hours later and that was about right for me as well. The 3 hour drive right after was fine!"
Good for you! I'm planning to do the same once the shot is available to my baby. We are in an urban area and I see the kids' vaccines being more available in rural areas just like mine was.
"I got the vaccine at 33 and 37 weeks pregnant. My OB encouraged me, but said the reason for the wishes-washy wording from the ACOG is due to legal reasons. OBs don‚Äôt want to get sued on the unlikely event that there are complications from the vaccine."
"My twin boys were born perfectly healthy and full term despite the vaccine. There‚Äôs also been some evidence that the babies will have antibodies, and antibodies have been found in breastmilk of vaccinated mothers. I‚Äôm so happy with my decision to get vaccinated during pregnancy."
"My OB was so on board. I messaged her to ask is she would sign the form for me, and she had filed it out for me and signed it and sent it back within a few hours. Your OB is probably just concerned about some sort of liability. They get sued more than any other specialty."
"I have Kaiser and saw 3 different OBs during my check ups so I asked each of them if they thought it was safe for me to get the vaccine.  They all showed me the same article and said that they knew pregnant women who got the vaccine and were fine after a couple of days rest.  For both vaccines, I only had a sore arm."
"It‚Äôs probably because you were in a rural area. I‚Äôm having to drive about the same distance to get mine. I‚Äôm on a state border of a northern and southern state, where some from the southern state come up and work in the northern state. The people in the southern state are having a way easier time getting vaccinated than those of us in the northern one because not as many people south are getting it. Oh well, at least you were able to find an appointment! It sucks to deal with annoying people, but at the end of the day you are vaccinated and baby is safer."
"I noticed that too..when I called to ask, the doctor's office was encouraging for me to get it but in the call notes in my account it was very vague and just mentioned that there is no data to confirm blah blah blah."
It's like people don't know the difference between a drug and a vaccine. Yeah it would be a little freakier if this was some new drug but it's not. It's a vaccine. It's not like it's thalidomide. But I think that's the fear that people have. Also side note my OB is currently pregnant and got the vaccine herself.
"My OB said this to me as well. She just says that ""there's not enough data. It doesn't mean it's bad... it just means there's not enough data. But we don't think there is a grave risk (based on the science of the vaccine)"" and that she wouldn't discourage me from having a vaccine."
"My OBGYN has been my doctor since I was 16. I'm 31. She told me with others she has encouraged the vaccine, but given that I've had strong responses to vaccines in the past (I always run high fever), she says she supports my decision to wait, but doesn't blame me if I don't want to wait. I'm in my house about 90% of the time, my husband works from home, groceries are delivered, etc."
So I decided to wait.  But I don't judge anyone who doesn't want to wait. I think any decision that a Mom makes for the best of her child (within reason) is a good decision.
I chose to wait too because I'm like 3 weeks away from my due date? But as soon as i give birth and it's available to me I'll take it
"I would actually be more inclined to get it towards the end of pregnancy, it means whilst you are in hospital you have some level of protection, and your baby is developed enough that if you did have mild side effects they would be fine, or moderate side effects they are cooked enough to come out of the oven."
I had my baby last august and having to deliver while I was unconscious was my biggest fear next to straight up dying
"Good for you girl! I will be 11+2 next Wednesday when I‚Äôm scheduled to get my first round (Moderna as well). I literally cried when I got the notice to schedule it, from relief or excitement not sure which. I agree that we should take care of ourselves first, or we may not be around to care for others. There‚Äôs also a part of me that almost feels obligated, simply because the fact there‚Äôs not a lot of data on the effects of these vaccines during pregnancy. Think of how many lives, including ourselves, our experiences could save! And how much fear it could quell in others."
"But back to your point, we aren‚Äôt telling anybody I‚Äôm getting it because everybody has such a strong opinion on what pregnant women should or should not do with their bodies as it is, whether that be eating an ice cream cone or take baths or whatever. And ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that. My OBGYN did openly encourage it at least. Good luck mama!"
"I‚Äôm not worried about a sore arm, fever, or other side effects from the vaccine. I‚Äôm worried about what we don‚Äôt know because it hasn‚Äôt been tested on pregnant women."
"There is some data. Some of the people in the original vaccine studies ended up becoming pregnant and had no adverse outcomes. They‚Äôve done studies with pregnant animals and they‚Äôve had no adverse reactions. Pregnant women also routinely receive vaccines. Right now there aren‚Äôt any indicators that it would be dangerous. There is clear and growing data on the risks of getting covid while pregnant, including 3x increased risk of hospitalization, 13x increased risk of fatality and the risk of preterm labor."
"there are definitely good reasons to get the vaccine. but on balance, based on my personal risk of severe illness and exposure, i've decided to wait until i've delivered to get the vaccine."
"The CDC has recently released its preliminary data it's tracking over 30,000 pregnant women who've received the vaccine. The data so far show that there have been no adverse outcomes."
"I‚Äôm against this phrasing because it makes it sound like pregnant women haven‚Äôt gotten it and like we have no idea how it effects them which just isn‚Äôt true. It hasn‚Äôt purposely been tested on pregnant women.  Over 200,000 pregnant women have gotten it. We do have data and the data so far shows no reasoning to without the vaccine from pregnant women."
"If it makes you feel better the ‚Äúbaby factory‚Äù hospital here in town started a pregnant people only vaccine clinic on Monday, they are getting 100s of women a day and ran out of Appointments. I was there on Monday it felt so good to be waiting in socially distanced line in a room full of other pregnant women equally as jazzed to get the vaccine"
That is so awesome! I‚Äôd loooove to meet another pregnant person in Real Life.
"Same! There was another pregnant person in the park yesterday reading a book and I had to stop myself from walking over to them to say hi. I live in a big city on the east coast of the US, randomly trying to make friends in at park is not a thing we do."
Omg this so hard. Every time I‚Äôm out and about (which is so freaking rare) and I see a fellow preggo I do a hysterical wave and they always wave enthusiastically back at me ü§£
"Tangentially related, but this is part of the culture of motherhood that I absolutely despise. I hate the idea that, because we're pregnant, we must do what is absolutely optimal for the baby regardless of if what is optimal for them is even feasible or preferable for us. The idea that there might be some compromise in there where it might be slightly less optimal but still good/fine for baby and improves our QoL drastically as their host and parent is met with outrage and chastising and I really can't stand it. Sorry, my baby's outlook on life is a lot better if I'm healthy and cared for, too. They're not the only life that hangs in the balance here."
"Also, like, what do they expect will happen if you catch COVID while pregnant? I can almost guarantee the long-term unknown risk of developmental issues in the baby from exposure to this disease (especially if mom gets serious complications from it) is going to be so much worse than the unknown risk of getting a vaccine that, theoretically, should be no more dangerous than the TDaP or influenza vaccine."
"Yeah there‚Äôs definitely a cultural attitude in many places that motherhood should be a sort of personal martyrdom if needed. I was raised Roman Catholic where some women were considered saints for deciding to die or withhold lifesaving medical treatment so their unborn child can live. That‚Äôs a very personal decision, in my opinion, but it seems like society is definitely on the side of sacrificing the mother to save the child."
My husband and I had that conversation during my second trimester. I told him if anything happens he's to choose me.
I‚Äôm happy someone else has my same perspective. My other child needs a mother more than they need a sibling...
Something fathers don't have to deal with.
We treat them as heroes when they stick around and act decent and maybe change a diaper now and then.
"There‚Äôs two hospitals in my city, one a public hospital and one a private catholic owned hospital. I‚Äôm giving birth at the public hospital for the same reasons you outlined above. It is well known the catholic hospital in town tries to save the child always before the mom. And I was raised catholic as well but I do not subscribe to the belief that I have to die for my unborn child. No offense to anyone else, just my personal philosophy."
"That is so contrary to how I was brought up in Catholism. We were always taught that the parents relationship, sanctified through marriage, was important. Parent to child is important but not above spouse to spouse. So while the choice of dying so another can live is no doubt honorable, would be choosing to abandon your spouse, unless of course you both decided together. It's interesting to learn of differences of upbringing, even in the same religions."
"Yup! It was some hard work to find a secular hospital in my area, but I was not about to deliver at one of the Catholic hospitals. My husband seemed to think I was a bit nuts because he didn't realize they would put their beliefs above my medical care until I showed him a few things."
"I acknowledge your experiences but the church promoting a mother as a martyr doesn‚Äôt mean the opposite is bad. Sometimes we create these false dichotomies about moral choices. If a mother saves herself, it‚Äôs neutral‚Äîneither good nor bad. Its unfortunate that she had to make a decision at all. If she does the unexpected, the saintly, selfless route, that‚Äôs held up as virtue."
"Truth. 31w now and I went back on my ssris after a bad episode. Nobody cared that being med free had me a step away from being involuntarily committed. Everyone that found out was like ""what about the baby?"". Like idk Karen, what about the mom who was on the cusp of a psychotic break? Ridiculous."
"Hey, I'm right there with you. I have an extensive trauma history and I've decided I won't even attempt breastfeeding because of it, and the number of people who guffaw and go ""but BREAST is BEST"" and insist not only that I should, but I must and will change my mind is outrageous. I shouldn't have to disclose why I don't want to breastfeed and formula isn't poison, the baby will be fed and happy and I am less likely to spiral into PPD/PPA. I call that a win-win."
"I was prescribed some drugs from my OB. She is well aware of my current state, and advised me of these meds to help me, so I went to the pharmacist to get them. The pharmacist basically gave me the third degree and made me sign a piece of paper saying I was aware of the risks. He made me feel like a bad person and even had me questioning it at first. But I trust my doctor and as my condition got worse I took them. Without these drugs I would be constantly sick and would basically stop eating. I am in third trimester and hardly gained 1kg over my entire pregnancy because I have trouble eating. I hate being treated like my well-being doesn't matter!! It does matter."
"Preach!! That was the hardest part, mentally, about being pregnant. People expected me to become secondary and I was not for that lol."
Thank you for saying this. I‚Äôm not pregnant yet but am terrified to give birth in fear that they‚Äôll choose the baby‚Äôs life if shit hits the fan...
"I would want my life to be saved. I told my husband, ‚Äúsave me!!!‚Äù"
I don‚Äôt understand why the mothers health and well being goes out the window the minute she becomes pregnant! Women aren‚Äôt just incubators!
"I told my husband this too. I told him that if something happens, we can make another baby or if we can‚Äôt and still want a child, we can adopt. He agreed with me and seemed a bit shocked that I brought it up. I have read several stories where the husband had to decide last second whether to save mother or baby, so I thought it was important he know my wishes. I enjoy being alive, thank you very much!"
"My husband and I also agreed if something happened during pregnancy/labor/delivery that my life is prioritized. 2 grieving parents of a child they never met, is better than a grieving spouse who is now a single parent to a kid that will never know its mother."
"This was my thinking with my first born, and now that I have a child and am trying for a second, it's even more important to me that if it came down to me or baby that I live. In that situation, I'd certainly grieve for that child for the rest of my life, but that's much more preferable to me than leaving my current  son motherless and my husband a single father to 1-2 children."
100%
"Pregnant Neonatal NP here - I have unfortunately experienced mothers deliver prematurely due to them being critically ill with Covid (on the ventilator, meds not working to treat symptoms). I have also experienced babies dying from the complications. I have personally coded a baby from our NICU to the covid ICU so mom could meet her baby before he died in her arms. I have seen countless babies born prematurely and growth restricted several weeks or months after Covid infection in mom (we are looking at the data, but from my experience as well as the experience from former coworkers in a separate NICU they have also seen an increase in growth restricted infants following Covid infection)."
"I‚Äôm pregnant, I weighed the pros and cons - countless women have received the Covid vaccine while pregnant and there hasn‚Äôt been shown to be an increase in complications. My OB fully supported me getting vaccinated (she did stress the importance of taking Tylenol after to decrease the change of having a fever which can be dangerous for a fetus)."
"I got my second dose yesterday. I have a horrible migraine this morning, but am thankful I will be protected in a few weeks. Plus I am protecting my son (2) who isn‚Äôt able to get a vaccine. I deal with Covid + patients at work and would rather have the protection for myself and my family than risk any of us getting severely ill."
"Thanks for sharing your perspective, it must have been such a horrifying year for you. Wishing you a robust immune response and a quick recovery from post-vaccine symptoms!"
"They initially told us that you had to sign up on the list every day, but we only did it once. This has to be done in person at your local CVS, not online. They do prioritise wait listers by age (so someone that‚Äôs 55 would‚Äôve gotten a call ahead of us, given we‚Äôre 30), but you never know. We got a call today in the afternoon, they said that they had 4 vaccines left that were about to expire today.  The pharmacist was as happy to give two of them to us as we were to take them."

I called our local cvs to get on the list two weeks ago and got a call that same evening asking if I wanted to come get the expiring shot they had left over. Five members of my family all got a shot this way in the same week.
Were you in the last group as well? Also I know privacy is important but what part of California is this?
I am in my 30s with no qualifying health conditions and live a couple hours north of Sacramento. My other family that got the shot this way are in the Sac area.
I asked about this at my CVS and they said they weren't taking wait lists.
They had a recording when I called that said the same thing.
I tried this afternoon and they said the list was over 200 people long and weren‚Äôt adding new names
Edit: just wanted to add that I‚Äôm in San Mateo county.
CA eligibility expands to include MANY pre-existing conditions TODAY March 15!!!
Local vaccine center included that last Friday. Got my first!!
"called the local pharmacies and they all rejected me. ""We don't do a wait list"" :("
"I would go there in person. At our CVS, the guy doing the check-in wasn't the brightest and said that their wait lists were only for those people at risk and then said to go talk to the pharmacist. We did and asked the pharmacist what they do with expiring leftovers. Only then did the pharmacist say that they have a list for those, that they do assess and call people by age first, but to sign up anyway because you never know."
"It's definitely a YMMV thing, I doubt there's concrete CVS policies for this."
"I found a mixed bag (Whittier)- one CVS put me on the list by phone, one I had to walk in, one was maxed out. I think part of the trick here is picking ones that just started dispensing vaccines."
Which CVS put you on waitlist? I also live in Whittier
The one at Whittier and Hadley
Thanks! Will test my luck after work
"Same thing here, called a few and only one said to call back at 6. I wonder what the ones who don‚Äôt have a waitlist do with the leftovers?"
