I called our local cvs to get on the list two weeks ago and got a call that same evening asking if I wanted to come get the expiring shot they had left over. Five members of my family all got a shot this way in the same week.
It sucked but it is well worth it and seemed to vanish as fast as the bad symptoms appeared.Same here. Symptoms began in almost 12 hours post second dose. 24 hours from that? All symptoms gone -- even the arm pain where the vaccine was given.
"My wife still has some symptoms, especially the arm pain, but me? I’m basically feeling better than I did before all this. Maybe I’m slowly turning into a robot, but hopefully one who can socialize guilt free. Maybe there’s some lingering stomach stuff, but overall pitch perfect."
"This is helpful. Thank you! A week after my first dose, I got ""Covid arm,"" so I am getting anxious for the second dose. I love to read anecdotes!"
