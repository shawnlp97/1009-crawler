The FEMA site at Valencia West. I heard it’s super efficient and well ran.Edited to add: I got J&J in Jacksonville over the weekend and it was a great experience.
"+1 for FEMA.Got vaccinated at the site in Tampa on Saturday, and without appointments we we in and out in under an hour – that's including the time we had to wait at the end so they could monitor for reaction to the vaccine. They had a choice between Pfizer and J&J."
very interesting.  studies starting to indicate that those with significant symptoms after vaccine likely have had Covid before...
"Do the studies dive into why that is? If the body previously created antibodies and the memory cells learned how to make them, my uneducated guess would be the body should more easily tackle it?"
It is my understanding there is still a shortage of sorts of the J&J vaccine until the end of the month when there will be a more plentiful supply.At that time I would probably assume the cvs/Walgreens of the world will enter the vaccine rollout hard core and then it will be relatively easy to obtain a vaccine.This is all my opinion and my own speculation but don’t anticipate widespread J&J distribution for at least another month maybe longer
