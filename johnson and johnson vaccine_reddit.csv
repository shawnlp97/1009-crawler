There aren't many posts about J&J yet. I got mine this morning. Feel free to ask me anything.
Can you update later if you have any other side effects?  Iâ€™m set to get mine next week and I hear rumors that it might be J&J.
"Yes, I will."
"Not OP, but got mine on Monday. First day felt great. Next day I felt like I got hit by a truck. Probably a solid 3-4 consistent acheyness all day long. Got gradually better through the day with ibuprofen, and felt fine today. 27 yo if that info helps"
I got it yesterday and I can confirm it feels like you got hit by a truck the next morning
"For me it toned down the next day. I get some bouts of fatigue the week after, but not sure if that's due to the vaccine or DST."
What is the capital of Spain?
Madrid
This guy is good
I just got the J&J vaccine today and feel totally fine. No pain or nothing. Hopefully it stays this way!
"To those who got the vaccine, can I ask your ages? I just scheduled my 89 year old mom for J&J and she is nervous."
Got mine today 30
"Got mine today, 30. Feeling fine overall but about 6 hours after the shot I started to feel achey/stiff, and have a low grade fever. Arm sore at first but that wore off for me pretty quickly and now it isn't bothering me much."
45
"36 got it 3 hours ago, teacher"
"Same age, got mine yesterday.  A little soreness in my arm, other than that feel perfectly fine."
Not feeling too great today. You?
Sorry to hear that.  No issues for me other than a little soreness in my arm.  Hope you feel better soon!
Same
Any plans on going to the movies anytime soon?
"I hadn't even thought about it! I'll probably wait a bit, but it will be nice to go inside Costco again. I live in a very anti-mask state, so my family has used grocery pick up services. We will continue to wear our masks though."
"Same here ... have been missing Costco rotisserie chickens for the last year, but given how people around here are, we've only done grocery pickup."
""
"I texted a coworker recently that having had both doses of the vaccine, I was now ready to go through the Starbucks drive thru. lol."
"Omg, itâ€™s so funny that you say that- I havenâ€™t been to Costco in a YEAR and am so looking forward to going again!"
"Its funny you say that as this week 1 year ago was the last time I went into a costco, and i loaded up for the beginning of the pandemic. I cant wait to go back shopping soon!"
Costco has a company-wide mask policy. Was your local warehouse not enforcing its own mask policy?
"Granted, Costco allows customers to wear face shields instead."
"I went in a few times, and it was enforced at the door but past that point people took their masks off."
"It's worth flagging an employee down, or going to the Customer Service desk, and asking to speak to the manager if necessary."
"If the manager said no, I'd passive-aggressively ask how the manager spells his name and write it down, then report it to corporate through Costco.com."
You might be surprised. The manager might approach unmasked customers. My local warehouse has a viral video with a customer being removed by cops.
There is a local market I shop at several times a week and I got pissed at there being so many chin maskers. I complained in private mail to the store's Facebook account and they told me straight up to inform the manager and those customers will be told to wear their mask or leave.
"how long will you have to continue to wear your mask, even if vaccinated?"
Until mask mandates are dropped in my state. Or until I feel comfortable with the levels in my area.
The entire mask thing is what confuses me. At first they said masks did nothing and now they still say wear them even if vaccinated. It just doesn't make sense to me.
They could have done better explaining the reversal but it's simple. Masks were first proposed as protection for the wear (standard use as PPE). However low quality masks aren't great at this and there were not enough for health care workers of the better ones. Then the data started rolling in that presymptomatic and asymptomatic people were damn contagious before they knew they were sick and putting masks on them reduced transmission hella good! So that means everyone wears a mask because you can't tell if you're a plague rat till the damage is done. (Or to use a saw analogy - it's like putting a dust collector on a saw so the whole shop stays clean - if you have 10 saws in the shop they all need collectors or its point less.)
Bc vaccine doesnt totally stop the spread of it.
well isn't that just fantastic
I like this article about why they are still recommended. https://health.clevelandclinic.org/already-vaccinated-heres-why-you-shouldnt-stop-wearing-your-face-mask-yet/
just too many unknowns for my liking. Even with the vaccine things are still like walking on egg shells. Sick of worrying. So much misinformation at the beginning sadly totally took my trust in these people away.
It's wasn't misinformation - it was new data caused changes. That's how science works & people are used to rolling with the changes in real time. I have a set of 100 year old encyclopedias that pretty much wrong on everything.
Fauci admitted to misinforming on masks. He admitted that.
I understand. I really hesitated on getting the vaccine.
"I am as well. I want to be able to go do things without being worried and actually enjoy myself. I know without the vaccine I won't likely be able to do that, but I also don't want to get one if it would have a negative impact. I am not an anti-vax person either. I also wish we knew more about how often we would have to get one and if it would be make me vulnerable for other things like common colds."
"My mind just keep going to Dr. Fauci and The prior Surgeon general saying mask do nothing and here we are. I want to trust them so bad, but...ugh. Its like mind games with myself."
My mind just keep going to Dr. Fauci and The prior Surgeon general saying mask do nothing
They both admitted shortly after that they were wrong. I trust Fauci at this point as well given how transparent he has been lately.
Really that's the most mask consistent place in Texas! 100%compliance all the time
I'm not in TX...lol
But Costco policy is national
"Same thing happens on Yelp. For whatever reason, human nature is such that we share negative experiences more enthusiastically than positive ones. If you had a nice dinner at a local restaurant, you're not that likely to write a bad review. But if you had a bad one? Much, much more likely to flame them online."
"Same here, people with mild or no side effects are going about their lives. People who are super anxious hypochondriacs are here telling us they feel a twinge in their eyelid sometimes. Take what you see here with a grain of salt. And if you have doubts ask your doctor about them, Reddit is famously terrible at giving medical & legal advice."
"As I said, Iâ€™ve had a lifelong fear of needles. (Iâ€™m 22). Ever since I was a kid Iâ€™ve had the WORST anxiety about getting them and could not sit still when getting my shots as a kid. Iâ€™d just about faint. When I turned 18, I literally turned down 4-5 vaccines I needed for college and had to sign a bunch of paperwork. Itâ€™s that bad."
"However, I live with older parents and just about my entire family has COVID risk factors. So I got vaccinated today. I was terrified, was having the same anxiety and freaking out again. Sweating, coughing, the whole 10 yards all day. I hid it pretty well from the nurse though once I got to the site."
"As soon as she wiped my arm down, I got really nervous... but when I tell you, AND BELIEVE ME when I say... it was NOTHING . I swear it was maybe half a second. Iâ€™ve always used the method of pinching my leg at the time of the shot to have another source of pain instead of just the shot.. and I can tell you my leg punch hurt a lot more than the needle. It was 0.5 seconds and it was done. Iâ€™m not BSing. My leg hurts where I pinched right now, not where I got the shot ðŸ˜‚ This vaccine helped me beat my fear of needles."
"Iâ€™m telling you, if anyone out there WAS like me and afraid of needles. Do not be. I can not believe I got myself so worked up over these things my whole life. Not to sound corny but Iâ€™m so proud of myself. Literally defeated a lifelong fear today. You can too."
I hope this post can help some of you! I know Iâ€™m not alone.
"by a post of someone's experiences getting and recovering from COVID-19. Yes, you might have some fever, chills, etc and this is a great place to confirm that you are not alone, but also these side effects are nothing compared to those like my dad who got covid and intubated for 40 days and we didn't know if he'd make it."
"Please get the vaccine, schedule a day or two of rest, and enjoy life :)"
Edit: spelling
"21F, college athlete, taking an SSRI as well as birth control."
"I got the Johnson & Johnson single shot vaccine yesterday (03/12) at 5:00pm, and felt fine the rest of the day and into the night. Arm soreness almost like I got punched, but that was expected."
"Woke up at 5:00am feeling like absolute death. (I was expecting to see/hear any of my other family members that also got the vaccine awake and dying with me, but the side effects havenâ€™t seemed to hit them...) I didnâ€™t know if I was going to make it from my bed to the toilet. I was having intense chills that shook my whole body, horrible nausea, and shortness of breath (all which the woman administering said were normal). I was violently sick in the toilet, with so much force that I peed myself. Have not thrown up like that since $2 Fireball shot night."
"I am back in bed resting now, hoping and praying that whatever the hell that was does not come back in waves."
"I keep seeing posts on here about anxiety getting the vaccine due to side effects 3 or 4 days post shot. I am in an opposite boat, I am more concerned about what the vaccine may/may not do in 6 months from now, a year from now, 5 years from now, etc."
That is what bothers me the most and is making me apprehensive.  Add in the fact that we don't even know how long the protection lasts.
I know effects from covid could be bad time from now as well. Its just all very consuming thinking about it.
"Got my second Pfizer shot yesterday. My anxiety was through the roof scared about the side effects because I truly couldnâ€™t miss work today. Had no effects from first one, my arm was barely sore. This time the soreness is a bit stronger and it feels like my shoulders and back are sore like I slept wrong- but otherwise no other side effects at all. Even if I had gotten the not fun side effects this still would have been 100% worth it!"
"34/F/minimal health issues (smoker, drinker- I know I know) average weight"
I donâ€™t see a whole lot of posts about second shots for Pfizer or ones that explain they didnâ€™t have a hard time so just adding my voice to this subreddit. I think my fears were made a lot stronger reading some posts- but honestly at least those posts let me know to be aware.
"Happy vaccinating yâ€™all! My 35 birthday is Saturday and I canâ€™t believe life has made me think getting a shot was the best birthday present ever, but here we are! Haha"
"At 5PM Friday my wife and I got the jab. Felt a boost of energy but nothing much to write home about for the first few hours. There was some slight pain around the injection site, but that was it. Went to bed around 11PM."
The next morning I woke up at 4am with the worst arm pain in the world. The ache was so intense it was almost blinding. I did some exercises with that arm and it seemed to go away within a couple hours of being up. I was unable to get back to sleep. Everything manageable up until this point.
"And then 11am hit and WHAM(!) I got a full on assault from the moderna second dose. Hot and cold flashes, nausea, being so dizzy I could barely walk, heavy brain fog, stabbing sensation from the inside of my chest out, aches.... I felt this way for a solid five hours and it was among the worst Iâ€™ve ever felt in my life if not the absolute worst. I went to bed at around 10PM and woke up at 10am this morning...."
"I feel 99.99999 if not a full 100% better. â€”â€” It sucked but it is well worth it and seemed to vanish as fast as the bad symptoms appeared. I hated the feeling, but if this means Iâ€™m getting an immunity against Covid Iâ€™m all for it and would do it again. In fact Iâ€™m surprised how short that bad experience was. It was almost like taking acid for those who knows what itâ€™s like to wake up the next day and feel alive again. Life has a lot more promise going forward."
"I posted this because I kept combing through this subreddit yesterday and I kept reading about people feeling f-cked five days later. Iâ€™m not saying that canâ€™t happen, Iâ€™m just saying it didnâ€™t happen with me. I maybe feel a little upset in the stomach, but itâ€™s barely noticeable and Iâ€™m soon to go for a walk around town. Donâ€™t let some of these stories scare you, even the worst symptoms turn around fast. My story is the proof! This page seems to have too much anxiety on it â€”- but alas, reddit. Ha. GET VACCINATED!"
"Got my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine on January 18, was scheduled to get my 2nd dose February 15 but I live in PA and they had a shortage of 2nd doses. I finally got it February 25 around noon."
"I felt great the rest of the day, went to bed and woke up in the middle of the night with some mild chills and a low-grade fever (100.4). Took ibuprofen and went back to sleep. Had a mild headache the next day but the fever never returned! Just wanted to share my non-horror story and encourage everyone to pursue vaccination :)"
Timeline:
"Shot at 9:30am, March 10th."
4.5 hour drive from place where I got shot to home (stayed overnight in hotel).
Arrived home and was an emotional wreck. Probably from the drive but possibly from the shot too.
March 10th: arm hurts like it was hit by a major league change-up. A little achy. Very fatigued.
Sleep: decent. No chills. No fever. Just body aches and arm pain.
"This morning, March 11: just achy and a little fatigued. No fever or chills. Nothing crazy. I just wanted to share my boring, mild symptoms because they happen too. Iâ€™m 31 and in great shape for the most part. I feel decent. Definitely much better than I expected to feel. Iâ€™m gonna take it easy today, drink water and eat."
Hope this eases some peopleâ€™s health anxiety. I kinda just feel like Iâ€™m hungover but without the throbbing headache.
Edit: 30 hours out and I pretty much feel fine except for arm pain.
Update: feel 100% normal today. Itâ€™s worth it everyone.
Sore arm. Thatâ€™s it. Same as first dose. No side effects. Got the shot at 2pm itâ€™s 12am. Nothing.
Donâ€™t let this forum fool you. Most people feel nothing. Will keep you updated.
I am a 19yo male with East Asian ancestry living in Hong Kong. My health is generally good except being borderline underweight (BMI 18).
"This morning (local time) I got my first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. I visited one of the 29 temporary Community Vaccination Centres (CVC) located around Hong Kong. I booked my visit 1 week ago, as my part-time job was considered a high-risk occupation eligible for the vaccine since 9 March. 8 of the 29 centres in Hong Kong offer the Sinovac vaccine while the rest offer the Pfizer vaccine. You can pick which vaccine you wish to have by choosing the individual centres. The online booking process is quick and straightforward."
"This morning I arrived at my centre on time. At the centre I was first asked to fill a health declaration (declaring you do not have history of recent travel, close contact with covid-19 patients, or any covid-19 symptoms). Then I receive a booklet explaining any possible reactions, risks and any points to note about the vaccine. After going through the booklet by myself I am asked to give consent by signing on the booklet. Immediately I am led to an available vaccination station. At the vaccination station the staff checked my ID, and asked me about any allergy or chronic diseases which may make vaccination unsafe(luckily I don't have any). Proof of occupation was actually never asked during the process."
Then the actual injection happened on my weak left deltoid. I think I have less than average needle anxiety as I am a regular blood donor. I feel a mild tingling at the injection site for about 2 seconds. The vaccination process was ultra fast. I spent only 8 minutes from entering the centre to actually getting the injection (!).
"After the injection I was asked to stay in a resting area for 15 minutes so that any serious reactions can be monitored. I felt a mild numbness at the injection site immediately after the injection then it goes away after 5 minutes. At the 30 minute mark I started to feel a mild soreness and warmth at my left upper arm. It it still sore after 6 hours but the pain is far from intolerable. Apart from the mild soreness I don't feel any reaction to the vaccination. It seems that my body is quite happy with the vaccine. Definitely recommended to anyone who hasn't got your vaccination.  However, if you job involves manual labour I would suggest you take the vaccine in the weekend so that it won't affect your work."
"Sitting in my car in the after waiting area, have about 5 minutes left in the observation time. Received my one shot J&J, 40/F with hypertension as a qualifying condition."
"I, like many of the posters here, get anxiety around health conditions and taking meds/getting vaccines. I have had the flu, tetanus, and Hep A vaccines within the last 5 years with zero after effects."
Will update as the day/night goes on!
10:30 am  2 hours out. Feel good. Temp at 98.3
