"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists sees no reason to deny the vaccine from pregnant women - meaning, they see no significant safety issue with vaccinating pregnant women. Before COVID, women have been recommended to other vaccines - the COVID vaccine is really no different other than it's an innovative mechanism. There's no reason to suspect that the COVID vaccine with pose a danger/risk any different than the other vaccines recommended for expecting moms.But there has been quite a bit of reason to prevent COVID in pregnant women - it can cause more severe illness for the mother. So if it's about safety - it is logically more safe to deal with any side effects from the vaccine than getting COVID.I work in a hospital and review charts. I've seen several women come in with COVID, go into respiratory failure, get placed on a ventilator, and the baby had to be delivered while the mother was critically ill. I would take the sore arm, fever, and nausea I got from my vaccine over that scenario 100x over."
"Thanks for sharing this.Honestly, the person who surprised me most of all was my OB-GYN. She seemed to sort of like the idea of me getting vaccinated when we discussed it in person, but when I messaged her nurse to get a doctor's note (to bring with me the vaccine appointment; in case I had to show proof of my condition to meet the state requirements) she came back with this strange noncommittal response.To be told by the pharmacist to basically ""think twice"" about the vaccine right before getting jabbed while surrounded by people in a rural Walmart not wearing masks was a surreal experience for sure."

I called our local cvs to get on the list two weeks ago and got a call that same evening asking if I wanted to come get the expiring shot they had left over. Five members of my family all got a shot this way in the same week.
It sucked but it is well worth it and seemed to vanish as fast as the bad symptoms appeared.Same here. Symptoms began in almost 12 hours post second dose. 24 hours from that? All symptoms gone -- even the arm pain where the vaccine was given.
"My wife still has some symptoms, especially the arm pain, but me? I‚Äôm basically feeling better than I did before all this. Maybe I‚Äôm slowly turning into a robot, but hopefully one who can socialize guilt free. Maybe there‚Äôs some lingering stomach stuff, but overall pitch perfect."
I love your writing style. Congrats on the shots!
Thank you! I never thought we would be excited about shots of vaccine vs shots of tequila but here we areüòÇ
"This is helpful. Thank you! A week after my first dose, I got ""Covid arm,"" so I am getting anxious for the second dose. I love to read anecdotes!"
I got my first dose a week ago and just woke up this morning to ‚Äúcovid arm‚Äù. How long did it last for you?

"My SIL got the same thing but the rash started spreading. This was not while pregnant (but she was chasing my 14 month old nephew at the time). She was super uncomfortable but it went away pretty quickly. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with something similar. Thank you for sharing it. Even with the bumps in the road that people have been sharing (and these have been INVALUABLE!!), I cannot wait to get vaccinated. I‚Äôm currently 11+3 and I hope I can get the vaccine early in the second trimester (I check every day for appointments but there‚Äôs ZERO availability in my area right now)."
"I am so sorry your SIL has dealt with a rash! I was glad I didn‚Äôt get that! And I am with you 100%!! Even with these inconveniences (minor, to be honest), it‚Äôs still sooooo much better than covid. I feel lucky I was able to get it! I also happened to time it just right and got myself and my husband (he takes an immunosuppressant, so he also qualified) appointments right before they opened it up to ages 50+.Have you tried getting added to cancellation lists with local pharmacies? I didn‚Äôt do that but have heard some people having success there. Also, I was initially told to go through the health department to schedule, but they were trying to send me 300 miles away!! I checked websites of local grocery stores and pharmacies and got lucky there.Good luck to you in getting it scheduled!! This gives me hope for some sort of normal in the near future. üòä"

"Says Pfizer right in the tweet, not Moderna."
"My gf just got a job in a medical office and qualified for a vaccine, so we made an appointment at the Lynchburg site and made the drive Saturday afternoon. When we pulled up to check in they asked me if I was getting it and I said I didn't qualify at all, but they ended up practically begging me for an excuse to give me a dose. When I mentioned that I have psoriasis they said ""AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER!"" and signed me up on the spot.I'll second the fact that the Lynchburg drivethru site is run very well. In and out in 30 minutes including the 15 minute waiting period afterwards."
My friend that lives in DC was told that Virginia was doing the exact same thing.

Does this mean that all of the doses thus far received in other countries were being exported from the US?
I'm not sure this has anything to do with the covid vaccine in particular but just with shots in general.I got my flu vaccine last September and they asked if I were on blood thinners for that as well.
Oh that makes sense. So maybe I should just monitor the injection site a little more closely?
Thanks. I also had Covid and have been looking for how folks are doing with their shots. I get mine on Wednesday. I‚Äôll take the side effects. Anything to not get Covid again. I‚Äôm still dealing with the effects of it.
"I'm curious if fibromyalgia causes sensitivity to drugs/vaccines with everyone, or at least most.I can't take most drugs, even Aleve messes me up. The flu shot causes terrible things so I no longer get one. Just about every vaccine I've ever had screws with me pretty bad.Though, my mom who never reacts to vaccines and my nieces' mom both suffered horrible side effects to this vaccine. My mom felt like she had the flu for over a week with BOTH shots."
"Mamakwa got his first shot Feb 1 in Muskrat Dam, ""at the request of First Nations and public health leaders,"" as part of a campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy in First Nations communities.

Great! I am also glad we are upholding our duty to FN and getting the reserves vaccinated
"Thank you for this. I got my second dose today at 12:45 pm, it‚Äôs now 10:30 and I‚Äôm feeling pretty normal but I‚Äôm so anxious about when the side effects will kick in. I‚Äôve heard the second dose is much worse so I‚Äôm in bed just waiting with Tylenol and cold water lmao.My first dose was pretty rough. Bad chills and n* throughout the night but felt pretty much better in the morning, just general malaise.Any side effect beats covid, but boy am I anxious just waiting for the side effects to kick in /:"
You‚Äôll have to let me know how you feel. I have also heard that people who get bad side effects with the first shot have an easier time with the second. You got this.

I haven't gotten vaccinated yet (the window just barely opened for pregnant people in my state and I'm so close to the end of my pregnancy we're waiting until after baby gets here because of mostly logistics since babies arrive when they want and could interfere with my second dose) but a friend got the Moderna vaccine and was feeling better the next day after their symptoms began. I hope it's the same or better for you! Feel better!
