Why are you on the fence? The vaccine protects against serious illness and death in most cases. Both my husband and I have had both doses. He’s Pfizer and I’m Moderna. Millions have received the vaccine. Join us!
Reflecting on my experience with the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I feel totally fine. No sickness. No flu. Just some soreness last night. It’s now been 24 hours and I’m totally fine. 
I’ve been thirsty as hell since I got my Pfizer. Maybe not related to vaccine.
"Dude.. that's THEIR vaccine, and the fact it prompted a poor immune response led them to ditch it. The Astra Zeneca and Pfizer jabs give a stronger immune response than a typical Covid infection, and that has been proven. They also drastically cut the likelihood of onward spread."
"What are your concerns about the vaccine? Although I am a bit leery because I have a history of anaphylaxis and the conflicting information about Pfizer, I will be getting the vaccine. I would rather take a (very small) risk rather than get Covid. Plus it benefits everyone."
"Thank you for addressing this, I am interested in the AZ or JnJ vaccines over the Pfizer and Moderna, but it’s hard to find reliable sources that drill down into it."

"I just got the first Pfizer shot and am scheduled or the second. Hey Nick, serious question. What’s the down side to taking the vaccine?"
Just got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and my body has the power to filter fluoride out of water and I can see lizard people.
"I got the Pfizer vaccine. A couple hrs after I got the second shot, my arm was hot and achy. I put an ice pack on it and took two aspirin.  It was fine the next morning."
Now that I’ve gotten the Pfizer vaccine can I start discriminating against people who have gotten the Moderna one?

What is your opinion on this Pharma trade of COVID-19 vaccine. A great opportunity to make billions by fleecing billions.  @pfizer @pfizer_news @BioNTech_Group @AstraZeneca @SinovacVaccine @moderna_tx  (1/3)
"What logistics? There were none. He handled vaccine distribution the same way he “handled” the pandemic. It was the Hunger Games all over again. No federal response. He declined ordering vaccine for God’s sake. As to the vaccine, no fed $ was used for Pfizer or Moderna."
"Check the schedule, he’s getting a 30K shipment from Moderna plus 30K from Pfizer this WEEK. More than this week and more than the first week of April. It’s a lie. It has been steady &increasing.’Week worth delayed’? You’re even blowing up Moe’s lie, he said 30% of 1 vaccine."
I had mine earlier. Its just a little prick. If you want a bigger one then ask for the #PfizerVaccine

"We'll see if either of us have a reaction.  The center can give any of the 3 vaccines, based upon availability. If moderna or pfizer they automatically set up the 2nd appointment."
PMJT says Canada will get over a million doses of the Pfizer Biontech vaccine per week through to the end of May #cdnpoli #COVID19
"Just had my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. I felt a little emotional if I’m honest. With numbers coming down and lockdown easing getting nearer, I’m starting to feel the gloom lift."

"Got vaccine 2 (Pfizer) last night.  About 12 hrs in, the 2nd one is going far easier than the 1st one.  I'm guessing partly because I can mostly eat like a normal person again & I wasn't dehydrated when I got it this time.  Still glad I took the day off just in case."
"16-17 years olds meeting Madison County Criteria and eligible in Illinois Phase 1a, 1b, or 1b+ can schedule a vaccine appointment with parental permission. Currently, the only manufacturer approved for this age group is Pfizer.  #vaccine #minors #COVID19 #VaxUpIL #publichealth"
"Tell the EU to stop taking 2 months to approve every vaccine. Again, the US & UK are having no problems. Over 50% of Pfizer/AZ vaccines have been made in the EU by British/American companies... so again, why are so few Europeans being vaccinated then..."
Quitling sh1t USA bansexport of C19 vaccines and treatments Inc. 30m AZ doses they won't use UK AZ vaccines hit because India has stopped exports UK bans export of medicines from 2021.01.01 EU allows export of 10m Pfizer doses from Belgium  And it's all EU fault!!
YES!  Congratulations!  Please let us all know how your vaccine chip works.  I get my 2nd Pfizer shot on Monday afternoon.  I am so looking forwarded to my chip  being upgraded to Pro Model 666.

"Ummm, no. The first company to announce a vaccine, Pfizer, wasn't even in Warp Speed.  ""Operation Warp Speed"" was just the Trump administration going ""Come onnnnn.... hurry uuupppppp..."" to pharma companies and putting up some money. Bare minimum any admin would have done."
"The EU do not make vaccines - private companies do.  The EU would be unwise to interfere with private legal contracts.   Supply chains for vaccines are global and complex.  For example, the lipids used in the Pfizer vaccine tend to come from the UK "

And Germany & France were already rolling out the Pfizer vaccine as fast as their distribution systems could cope. It’s not like they were sat around waiting for AZ to finally deliver as promised...

"Health experts have differing views over the benefits of giving more people their first shot and waiting a longer time to administer the second dose, or whether to stay the course and prioritize getting both doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine into arms as quickly as possible"
