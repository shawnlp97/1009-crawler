"Also , if he didn’t take the AZ vaccine and had Pfizer the conspiracy theory lovers would be saying ‘ there he knows AZ isn’t safe . One rule for him and another for all of us ‘"
that's interesting. my wife volunteered for a while a few weeks ago booking in vaccination slots for a local surgery and many of the old dears were refusing the pfizer vaccine and asking for the oxford one...
Covaxin made by Bharat Biotech has not reported severe side effects like the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine.Personally I want to take Covaxin it's  much safer then these foreign made including Pfizer.
And he got the Pfizer vaccine - ie the most effective one that ISN’T causing rare blood clots and anaphylaxis in 20-50 year olds.
"Scrutiny for sure. Many people, who are suspicious of vaccines but understand the need will perhaps wait it out for Pfizer, but many family doctors are only using AZ.It is time that we just make AZ available to whoever wants it, regardless of age."
Does the link you have identified also apply to the other vaccines including the mrna? I am interested as in the US similar platelet issues I think have been found post Pfizer and Moderna jab. Is there anything you can add?

"That has NO relevance on whether the EU has the right to block exports. There is a contract between Pfizer and the UK. The UK are paying for the vaccines at x5 the price of AZ. Incidentally, the UK funded AZ including plants in the EU but that isn't relevant either."
"getting the Pfizer vaccine when it's the AZ one people are worried about does nothing to instill confidence, and then passing laws making it illegal for doctors to tell patients which vaccine they're getting exacerbates this"

EU costing lives. Need to look at the knock on effect of blocking use. Thousands put off taking safe vaccines. If their complaint is more about the US export ban why not say so. All evidence including Pfizer blood clots suggest it's all political.
Pfizer mRNA vaccines manufactured in the EU are entirely reliant on a specialist pharmaceutical lipid made and supplied by Croda in the U.K. The vaccines actually use more lipid than mRNA. Sending some Pfizer doses back to U.K. is fair.Unless they don’t want the lipids.

https://express.incwajana.com/2021/03/18/sahpra-approves-section-21-use-of-pfizer-vaccine/… SAHPRA approves Section 21 use of Pfizer vaccine
The trouble is now there is a lack of trust in the AstraZeneca vaccine. That is why people don’t understand the reasoning for the EU’s actions when trust of the vaccine is now so low in Europe. She said there weren’t supply issues with Moderna & Pfizer.
"I don't think that's right. The AZ vaccine also uses mRNA, but delivered to cells in an adenovirus package, but once it has got into the cells, it is unpackaged and there is no reason to think it sticks around for longer than Pfizer's RNA.  It is replication deficient."
Like the Pfizer one that has caused more blood clots? That safer vaccine? Is that the one you are talking about?
"No the EU hasn't exported any vaccines.Pfizer, AZ, etc have.The EU haven't done anything other than fuck up the vaccine process. It would have literally been better if you'd done nothing.Like i've done more for Europe's vaccine programme and i haven't don't anything."

"He did not announce no jabs for the whole of April. Just no new appointments for those under 50, not in high risk groups. Supply issue with a batch of AZ vaccines from India but UK produced supply (over 1 million doses per week) still normal. Pfizer supply also as expected."
If you have your vaccine at a hub you will be getting the Oxford AstraZeneca - the hubs don’t have the refrigerator facilities required for the Pfizer - the Oxford AstraZeneca doesn’t need to be refrigerated at such a low temperature. Hub=AstraZeneca
This is not the case. People are making an appointment and then refusing the vaccine. This risks wasting vaccine and that is just wrong. I asked which vaccine at the time of making my appointment. I turned it down because it was Pfizer. I am now happily AZ'd and waiting for dose2

It’s a company in India producing the vaccine under license where the problem lies so strictly speaking AZ and Pfizer don’t have supply issues. There’s a 4 week delay apparently to half of the order ergo the issue should only really be a 2 week issue.
AstraZeneca jab is being sold at cost during the pandemic the Pfizer vaccine is not

Absolutely not  roadmap won’t be delayed as all those over 50 will have had the vaccine by then who account for 99% of death.There is no shortages Pfizer and Aztrazenca have both confirmed that so it doesn’t add up there should be no supply issues at all.
The supply chain slowing for a component of the vaccine comes from the serum institute in India (not stopping) The Pfizer one is made in Belgium so I'm thinking the EU is up to something we'll have to wait and see. Just glad we not totally reliant on others eh we will be fine

Is anybody getting the Pfizer vaccine or is it only for the rich?
As of today 89.3% of all vaccines received in Ontario are in people's arms. The supply was slow at first due to Pfizer restructuring their EU plant. Deliveries are scheduled to increase dramatically next week. We will beat the Sept target date just by deliveries scheduled now.
Both vaccines are excellent. What makes a massive difference is delaying the time between first and second doses to 12 weeks. This step reduced UK hospital admissions in UK by 75%. In turn this has saved 1000's of lives. This is resisted by Pfizer because it means fewer sales
Yet the incidence of thromboembolic events in the pfizer vaccine is approx equal to the astra......and such events in women on the birth control pill are much higher than any of the vaccines
UK supplies materials to manufacture the Pfizer vaccine 
Production issues in context of unprecedented supply & demand levels for new vaccine approved in record time shouldn’t be a surprise. Pfizer initially couldn’t meet UK demand despite long standing contract. J&J & Novavax clearly aren’t ready to meet our demand yet.

Obviously neither the EU or the UK produce vaccines. If you equate AZ as being ‘the UK’ (as some people seem to think) then all of the AZ vaccines produced in NL and Belgium have been ‘exported’ to the EU. Just happens that Pfizer don’t manufacture in the UK.
The big flaw in this totalitarian plan is the fact that some of the raw materials needed for the Pfizer vaccine (made in Germany) comes from.  Yes you guessed it the UK.So its a dangerous game @vonderleyen is playing one that will kill thousands of EU citizens
"Vaccines in short supply? We ordered 400 million? We’ve only done 25 million, where is the rest? Pfizer still have some to deliver surely? Is this their cover up of halting the rollout due to safety concerns??"

Pfizer mRNA vaccines manufactured in the EU are entirely reliant on a specialist pharmaceutical lipid made and supplied by Croda in the U.K. The vaccines actually use more lipid than mRNA. Sending some Pfizer doses back to U.K. is fair.Unless you don’t want the lipids.

I am going around in circles here. If the  U.K. aren’t receiving any AstraZeneca vaccines from the EU & the only ones they are receiving are from Pfizer-BioNTech which exports are they going to stop? Pfizer who are meeting their targets.
"Every single dose of Pfizer vaccine manufactured in the EU, contains a lipid layer manufactured in the UK, without which their would be no vaccine! Should the UK limit the export of this lipid if the EU limits the export of the complete Pfizer vaccine to the UK?"

Same argument applies to development of BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine which was ONLY funded by EU & Germany NOT UK where German BioNtech is sole owner of licence & NO production site is in UK. Still UK received huge EU exports! #Brexit UK in turn HASN‘T exported a single vaccine dose!
"Oxford university donated the vaccine to Astra Zeneca. Pfizer invented it. Astra Zeneca has not donated IP to others.Also you have to prove AZ is not making profits for doses sold in UK. You are assuming many things.Point instead is clear,EU has rights to UK doses. By contract."
The only vaccines currently exported to the U.K. are from Pfizer-BioNTech & the EU said there aren’t any supply issues from Pfizer.
"The Pfizer vaccine contains polyethylene glycol. If you are allergic to polyethylene glycol, you are advised not to take the vaccine. Do you know if you are allergic to polyethylene glycol?"
"The 10m doses were imported to the uk before the eu even authorised the vaccine to be used. Also if they start a vaccine war, the base unit of the Pfizer vaccine is made in the uk so this isnt going to end well for anyone if a tit for tat starts."
There's been a lot of debate in the media recently about the AstraZeneca viral vector vaccine. This article in the New York Times explains how the vaccine generates an immune response and how it differs from the Pfizer mRNA vaccine also in use in the UK.
"We distribute our vaccines fairly amongst all 27 countries, and even export the EU developed BioNTech/Pfizer to many non-EU countries.I'm OK with that.That the UK and US don't ship anything back to us is disappointing, but not a surprise."
"The EU hasn't exported anything, Pfizer, a US company that happens to have located one of its factories in an EU member state exported vaccines to the UK. Those vaccines were reliant, in part, on a product manufactured and exported by a British company to Belgium."
"Another issues why Yonex All England2021 officials rejected Indonesian Team are:1. All visitors coming to UK would need to be inoculated w/ vaccines approved by European Medicines Agency (Pfizer/AstraZeneca/Moderna approved,soon J&J too). Indonesia maksinnya pake apah? Esemka?"
"25 million vaccinations so far in . Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines are saving lives."
"Ahh damn, yeah I've been wondering if J&J resembles shot 2 of the Pfizer / Moderna vaccines.  Honestly sounds like it, but if the recovery is about the same as those you will hopefully be feeling much better by tomorrow morning, and near 100% the day after."
And they would have no Pfizer vaccines at all

"Oh, I wanted to get the Pfizer shot (vaccine), instead I’ll just have the regular shot of Jack Daniels or Crown Royal "
"It's not stopping AZ from exporting to the UK, the proposal is to stop Pfizer which is a different company and has nothing to do with AZ 's contract. As this is the vaccine I and millions of others have taken, the EU are potentially putting our lives at risk for their own mistake"
"My mum, grandad and girlfriend all had the Pfizer vaccine and that was at a GP surgery. I had the AZ at a mass vaccination centre for healthcare staff"
American deep state is trying to push Pfizer & Moderna in EU countries to increase their sales. Its just a vaccine war. Eventually India will quietly take away the global market. India anyway meets > 50% global demand of Covid vaccines. There are at least 6 more vaccines in Q

COVID-19: Pfizer and AstraZeneca deny coronavirus vaccine shortage.https://planetradio.co.uk/metro/sky/home/covid-19-pfizer-and-astrazeneca-deny-coronavirus-vaccine-shortage/…
"BR Info-Byte: Both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, despite being in extensive distribution, have elicited certain unintended health effects including blood disorders, blindness and other reactions."
"And 4 doctors have an extremely rare type of brain clot shortly after being vaccinated.No explanation has been found yet.Your own vaccination is irrelevant, indeed most UK & EU vaccines are Pfizer anyway.Stop being triggered."
"Please provide well-sourced data supporting your claim that the Pfizer vaccine “has caused more deaths” than the AZ vaccine.No conspiracy theories and/or conjecture on your or anyone else’s part.Just proof from well-known, reliable sources.Thanks so much."
Notice the AZ vaccine is actually performing better than the Pfizer vaccine.Still the EU doesn't like the British vaccine. Wonder why...
CONCLUSIONSA two-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 due to the B.1.351 variant. Australia NEEDS more Pfizer or Novavax that provide better protection against B.1.351.
"Vaxx wars are funny and vaccines suck but when you look at the data it seems that Astra is actually ""safer"" then Pfizer. Less deaths, less weird stuff. Pfizer can make you shit yourself to death or go blind. Not kidding its in UK gov reports."
"Matt Hancock at yesterday’s presser claimed UK had ‘dibs’ on Astra Zeneca supplies, because vaccine was developed in partnership with UK gov’t. But the same can be said of Germany for Pfizer/Biontec or USA for Moderna. Nobody wins by sticking flags on medicines. We all lose. ~AA"

AZ is UK vaccine. Pfizer is German (EU)
"UK supplies key materials for the vaccine to the EU for pfizer, not just for AZ.Secondly AZ have sent a shed ton of vaccines to the rest of the world that are currently being blocked by the EU.Thirdly its business, governments dont own IP to businesses vaccines"
"All of the early released vaccines are due second dose, not just AZ my family have had AZ and Pfizer."
"And key elements of the Pfizer vaccine are manufactured in the UK. Does that make it also a ""British"" vaccine?Rather odd to be citing ownership of patents and the rule of law when you are defending a polity that wishes to ignore both?"
The UK is the only country the shoe fits. It’s the only country the EU is exporting to in significant numbers that has a more advanced vaccine programme than the EU. UK was organised EU weren’t and now they are rejecting our Oxford Vaccine and blocking the Pfizer one.
i get the pfizer vaccine tomorrow i’m nervous but excited 
"The EU didn't export anything. Pfizer is just fulfilling it's order book, from which the UK ordered quickly and the EU lagged behind. The vaccine is not the EUs to export to whom they choose fit."
I think they were aiming at Pfizer vaccine produced in Belgioum Why has no-one asked why we are dependant on India for AZ supply? I thought we put money into new production facilities to peoduce this vaccine???
And still the NHS heads wirk against the public majority and the govt.Pfizer and AstraZeneca deny Covid vaccine shortage

Are you sure the vile is Chinese vaccine? Probably Pfizer.
Pfizer and AstraZeneca deny a Covid-19 vaccine shortage for Britain https://ift.tt/38ORqhF
Why block exports of the Pfizer vaccine if the EU’s orders are being met?  The U.K. are still waiting for Moderna vaccines but because we ordered after the EU they have accepted that.
So got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday afternoon. I feel okay except for a sore arm. Rolled over on it and woke up immediately from the pain around 3 AM.  Couldn’t get back to sleep.  Not complaining! I will take a nap later today.

" Vaccine Shortage To Paralyse RolloutProduction issues mean under-50s will be forced to wait for their jabs, as EU threatens to block Pfizer exports to UK  @lauradonnlee @LOS_Fisher @JamesCrisp6#frontpagestoday #UK #TheDailyTelegraph "
"It's not the blocs own supply though mate. Pfizer have negotiated a contract with the UK, the EU don't own the Pharma companies. Some of the 10 million doses were shipped before the EU had even approved the vaccine"
"Pfizer expects higher COVID-19 vaccine prices and yearly boosters, CFO says. And that means big sales long-term | FiercePharma"
"I believe the US have received just under 1m doses from Pfizer, the US company with plants for worldwide based in the EU. It's interesting that the EU are silent about US government restrictions but jumping up and down over lack of vaccine from the UK which is a company decision."
"I sure hope so, I was given Pfizer, now quite concerned that the second jab may not be available if EU decides to stop exports. However with new variants developing all over, vaccine or not, can’t see myself feeling ‘safe’ or leaving my home any time soon."
"Pfizer is an American company that has a contract to sell vaccines to the UK, it just happens to have manufacturing plants in the EU.It's not an EU vaccine!"
"I know, I've had mine but the blood clotting scare along with the following media hype has not helped. Many were unsure because of the speed in which the vaccine was passed for use and other countries suspending use has raised concerns amongst some."
2nd vaccine done! Get me on a plane #CovidVaccine #Pfizer
FYI: Pfizer mRNA vaccines manufactured in the EU are entirely reliant on a specialist pharmaceutical lipid made and supplied by Croda in the UK The vaccines actually use more lipid than mRNA. Sending some Pfizer doses back to UK is fair.Unless you don’t want the lipids.
"Actually, Asrrazeneca is far safer than the mRNA vaccines. But Pfizer and Moderna are corporate sharks, and there is a propaganda campaign against other vaccines. Huge amounts of money and power at stake."
Certain centres issue certain vaccines. If I go to my local centre I'll get astrazeneca if I go to doctors roll out I'll get Pfizer.
"Les faits, seulement les faits :""In clinical trials, the Pfizer vaccine was found to be 95 per cent effective at reducing disease. But whether it stopped people from getting infected in the first place isn't yet known — because it wasn't measured"""
"If you get the J&J vaccine, 2 weeks after your only dose is fully vaccinated.  Moderna/Pfizer have the same stats after 2 weeks from a first dose, but we're being scolded to a. Be happy to get J&J vaccine b. Not behave like we vaccinated till 2 weeks after second dose of Mod/Pfi"
"The UK spent more risk money on vaccine development than the whole of the EU, it also paid more than 90% of the development costs of the AZ vaccine, but it only owns the production it signed contracts for. Same for the EU and Pfizer."

The UK helped develop the vaccine with an EU (Swedish) company.The UK relied on a German/US company (Pfizer) for all the vaccines that were used to vaccinate the most vulnerable in the UK. They were all made in the EU.
If she bans exports to the Uk one assumes the various products Pfizer need to make their vaccine thats produced in the UK will also be banned going the other way. All that’s going to happen is more people are going to die.
So EU threatening to delay Belgium made Pfizer vaccine while they level up the playing field? AZ made in India so they don't influence this. Correct?I don't think Covid recognises Brexit so surely it's in our interest to get as many vulnerable people vaccinated on both sides
"I tried to find the recent costs per dose of the various vaccines, but not available.However, AZ was at cost price, about $4, and Pfizer is about $20, American prices.Also, AZ doesn't have to be kept at extremely low temperaturesSafety issues might be for commercial reasons"
"I know my 3 children who have received the Pfizer vaccine are very grateful, as exceptional GB unable to supply enough vaccine for the whole population.  I am also happy to have received AZ vaccine though not sure if my dose came from U.K., Belgium, Netherlands or India."

"According to Hong Kong's local media, Sinochem has the lowest side effects. Much lower than Pfizer and az vaccines. In addition, the efficiency of the third phase of Sinochem's data in Turkey is 83%."
"Pfizer and AstraZeneca have rejected an NHS claim that the UK is facing a COVID-19 vaccine shortage, insisting there is no threat to supplies."
"When you know that the vaccine was prepared before Dec. 2019, you know there is a rat!Pfizer ordered 1 600 000 vaccine bottles resisting up to minus 100°c in Dec. 2019."

@Pfizer and @AstraZeneca deny domestic #Coronavirus vaccine shortage.
"Politics. The EU failed in their planning and execution. Now they are trying to shift blame. It is worth emphasising that vaccine exports are not organised by the EU itself, but by companies such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which use its territory as a global manufacturing base."
As a RGN I could never achieve the correct antibody response after receiving all courses & boosters for Hepatitis.My antibody responses seem inadequate. I declined my Zeneca vaccine on Sunday as I want the Pfizer vaccine to boost the chances of a favourable antibody response.
"That sucks,over here in Serbia we are buying vaccines from all sides whenever they are avaliable, we had Sputnik and Sinofarm the most, but also over 200000 Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccines. We immunized around a third of our population so far."
The EU is dependent on imports for ingredients to make the Pfizer vaccine.
"Let me keep it nice and short for you. 1- EU wasted time with their usual bureaucracy and wasted time in signing vaccine contracts 2- when faced political pressure UK is getting ahead, shame AZ vaccine and steal Pfizer deliveries "
"mRA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna seemed to have effects on blood clotting too, but these happen very rarely. Think twice before burning the AstraZeneca vaccine at the stake!"

"So he's now a human guinea pig, given the controversy. Either way, blood clots are synonymous with both Pfizer and the Oxford AztraZeneca vaccine. I doubt it will make a difference, it's you and your luck with the reactions to the vaccine. Manufacturers need to sort the issue out"
"You have too much exposure to turdface. It’s beginning to rot your mind.On another note, do you trust Scotties vaccine? My source tells me AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines are not safe."
This is the protectionism that not that long ago Guardianistas were railing against. Is the argument that only EU countries should be able to buy EU produced Pfizer vaccines?
"Exactly from the start everybody knew it would be a logistical operation. So far AZ, Pfizer and the NHS have done good. Plus no one expected a vaccine slanging match would break out in with the EU"
"reciprocity extends to the component parts of the Pfizer vaccine we send to them, seems the obvious response would be to block that.... cuts both ways"
The Iraqi government on Wednesday approved the purchase of Pfizer vaccine from the United States amid efforts in step up the vaccination campaign.
Got my first Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday get my second on the April 6th.
The U.K. approved the Pfizer before the EU & started the vaccine rollout before the EU also.
@BorisJohnson the second the U.K. received the first Pfizer vaccines back in January
Mom got her first dose of Pfizer. Have to be back there in 3 weeks. I registered and still not a word. Why won't they roll the vaccine out in mass all over the country? It would be faster and we might have avoided this lockdown. I'm just grateful my mom is now more protected.
Scott Morrison promised that all stage 1 Covid-19 Vaccine would be  Pfizer. Now all Stage 1b clients will get AstraZeneca. You LIED Slowmo. Blood Clots. The AstraZeneca vaccine  has shark parts and dead fetus cells. I know someone allergic to fish. PHIL

"As UK received massive EU exports of EU funded BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine while UK DIDN’T export a single dose,EU is in its right to stop all vaccines export to UK! Here are vaccine export figures of EU (34m doses) especially those to U.K. (9.1 million doses)"
"You know what is also really annoying about this, no one seems to mention the most important part of the Pfizer vaccine (the lipid layer) is actually manufactured in the UK (Croda, East Yorkshire)Wonder what the response would be if the UK threatened to stop the export of that?"
"I thought a key element of the Pfizer vaccine was only manufactured in the UK or USA, so if the EU want to play hardball....."
"Den israelske vaccinesucces er importeret og i høj grad baseret på Pfizer/BioNTech-vaccinen, som er udviklet i EU. Der israelische Impferfolg basiert ausschließlich auf EU Impfstoff. Auch UK hat zusätzlich große Mengen Vaccine aus der EU eingekauft."
"Ah, the EMA. Moves slower than glaciers. Just admit the EU backed the wrong horse, Pfizer and Sanofi due to vaccine nationalism. The French are as reliable as ever with the Sanofi vaccine only available from September at the earliest, never mind, there's no rush eh?"

I wonder what vaccines will i get later on. Sinovac or Pfizer. Can't wait for that moment.
"Who is giving these people professorial posts? The roll out is not ""progressing rapidly"". Where is the data? How many units of vaccine are guaranteed over the next 3 months to complete second dose for first round? Not enough as supply lines for AZ faltering badly? Pfizer for EU."
"Certainly true of the Pfizer one, which by definition is not a vaccine."
"The Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine appears to be less effective against the Covid 19 variant from South Africa.This is deeply concerning, especially if you take in to the consideration that the Pfizer Vaccine seems to show greater protection against the same variant in question."
There is absolutely no scientific evidence that a Pfizer vaccine followed by an AZ one gives extra protection. They are different vaccines and work slightly differently and no trial has been done to assess it they work together. It's total guesswork and crossed fingers!!

Do check your facts sunshine! A vital component of the Pfizer vaccine is manufactured in the UK. It is only made here and in the US. So without that part the EU would be pretty stuffed wouldn't they! (Especially with their boycott of the Oxford jab).
How many Pfizer vaccines administered in the EU contained British-manufactured materials 
AstraZeneca and Pfizer deny Covid vaccine shortage after NHS warns of disruption to supplies
"Who do we believe AZ or Hancock's BS?An AstraZeneca spokesperson said “UK domestic supply chain is not experiencing any disruption and there is no impact on our delivery schedule,” while their Pfizer counterpart said deliveries remain on track with a “steady supply of vaccines.”"
Some of the ingredients for the Pfizer jab are manufactured in the uk therefore if they stop the export of vaccine our answer is quite simple or is it  I ask.We are a democracy not a dictatorship so we would behave like a democracy and still export the ingredients
There's a global shortage.AZ say there isn't.We get many vaccines from many places.Pfizer then.What fun that was

What lab did Trump work at when he developed the vaccine? The Pfizer lab in Germany didn't get money from the US?
Lets ask another question.   Who initiated Operation Warp Speed?  Who ordered One hundred million vaccines when Pfizer first announced it's approval? The reason the US has the edge is not because of the current administration.

Maybe due to allergies. I couldn't have the Pfizer vaccine because of this and had to wait till the Oxford AZ was being given. So I knew in advance.

The UK provides the raw components too Pfizer to create their vaccine. People like you get suckered into the narrative without any clue on how these vaccines are made cross border and cross components.
"Propaganda..Just tell me why does the EU want the AZ vaccine when it’s commission was stating it was initially “ineffective”, now it is causing blood clots which is unfounded and as I said Pfizer has similar clot results but not stopped. WHY?"
Then Pfizer vaccine is made by CIA lol! #HotpotAlliance
"The EU muddied the waters for the AstraZeneca vaccine on purpose. AZ have been selling their vaccine, which is equally as effective as Pfizer or Moderna, for a fraction of the price ($3 per dose for AZ vs $19.50 Pfizer and >$25 Moderna). It's always about the money"
Pfizer TRIPLED the cost of my 90-day prescription. That's WITH the manufacturer's discount. Guess huge profits from government payments for the Covid-19 vaccine wasn't enough. @Pfizer @pfizerinc @PFIZERINC @americanhealthcare
"So the government galloped ahead of itself, vaccinating everyone without already having sufficient numbers of the vaccines, particularly the Pfizer one, to make sure all would get their 2nd dose. It was always a dangerous strategy, now millions will not get their 2nd Pfizer dose!"
": ""Figures out today show the UK health services vaccinated a total of 25,273,226 people between 8 December and 16 March with first doses of the Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines, while 1,759,445 people have had their second dose."""
Macron is not a scientist. He simply follows the guidance of his own Scientific team. A team not convinced by AZ studies. Adding in 2 weeks Pfizer reports a big vaccine load to the EU.

"This panic is political, not scientific. The Pfizer vaccine has been linked to just as many blood clots as the Astra Zeneca. A bit of online research will confirm this. More risky not to have the vaccination."
"I had the Pfizer vaccine as did Celina and we both had painful arms, my joints ached and we felt like we had a cold brewing. I was also really tired but that happens every day. Ha! Good luck and hope you are well. Take care. A beer in the near future me thinks."
"It's all so political.  They aren't pausing the Pfizer vaccine, made in America, which has the same statistics.  Its just a Brexit pop at UK isn't it."
Covaxin has caused severe side effects like what the Oxford Astrazeneca and Pfizer vaccines have caused so its much safer.I predict covaxin might turn out to be the best vaccine it's a big achievement for Indian scientists.
Do what you like m8! Had my first jab six weeks ago talking to the Nurse at my local Hospital I had Pfizer jab she told me everyone without exception at the Hospital had had Covid19 vaccine! Their choice no coercion 
I suspect they want to block AZ and compensate for its removal by grabbing everything from Pfizer. But I doubt that'll work as reagents for that vaccine are produced in the UK.
Pfizer vaccine price to go up
"I got my #PfizerVaccine first shot yesterday, and while I absolutely *loathe* needles, I barely even felt this one. It is now about 12 hours after the shot, and I am having no side effects whatsoever. We’ll see how my second shot goes. There’s light at the end of the tunnel!"
I will bw having the Astra Zeneca vaccine when called as I have alergies and Pfizer is not recommended. I am not concerened as you need to put the numbers in context.
"Thia puzzled me too but I think it’s because AZ and Pfizer are talking about their official supply to UK, whereas government is also sourcing  ‘grey imports’ of the same vaccines (eg the AZ vaccine from India as well as direct from AZ) It’s the grey import stuff that is delayed"
Yes you. Vaccine centres get one. That's it due to storage issues. Docs surgery are using Pfizer and our vaccine centre are doing astrazeneca. If doesn't change
Then they leave you with...These may not be all the possible side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19Vaccine. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19Vaccine is still being studied in clinical trials. IT'S STILL BEING STUDIED??
"Pfizer vaccine is made with raw materials supplied by a UK company, change the raw materials change the vaccine. You can't just pop to a supermarket for them."

Make sure you get Pfizer Covid vaccine  and not the other one manufactured in River-road na kiandutu ya Europe. - my brother from USA.
There’s a process. Can you name the date the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were ready for distribution? Go on... I’ll wait. :)
"Why do these people act like vaccine production is nationalised? This is beef between the EU Commission and AZ, or the UK and Pfizer, not the EU and the UK"
AZ is also only 22% effective against the South African variant. I fear booster shots will be needed a lot more in the UK than other countries which rely more on Pfizer/Moderna. Weaker vaccine = higher chance of giving the virus room to mutate
"The AZ vaccine is made in Wales and Oxford. The EU will shoot themselves in the foot as a component of the Pfizer jab in made in the UK.If we retaliated tit for tat, they couldn't make the Pfizer vaccine in Europe."
How is #pfizer supposed to make 30 billion if people can’t get to the “free” experimental vaccine?  Keep being a puppet for pharma.

"Adam, that is utter balls. Where do you think the original Pfizer and AZ vaccines to the UK came from? Belgium and Italy (you may not have heard of Italian firm IRBM who had an important role to play in the AZ vaccine development)! Seriously, do some research."
"Across EUrope and many other parts of the world, there was a significant spike in elderly deaths post Pfizer vaccine rollout.You dismissed this as coincidental.On what grounds? What evidence led you to this conclusion?"
"Malaysia has secured vaccines to cover about 80 percent of residents. About half of the population will be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, about 20 percent with AstraZeneca and Sinovac, points out Zarina Zainuddin and Muhammad Sinatra:"
You are allowed to choose where you have your vaccination. Some facilities do not have the refrigerators required for the Pfizer vaccine
"So EU exported BIoNtech/Pfizer vaccine whose invention and development was funded ONLY by EU & Germany NOT U.K., and U.K. doesn’t reciprocate with AZ vaccine although having received also millions of EU produced AZ doses in Dec 2020. So no further EU exports of BioNtech"

"Be honest, there are no issues with Pfizer and Astra Zenica production, where are the vaccines going?The EU?"
Thank you for clarifying to that the Pfizer vaccine is not affected. This was not clear in the reports.
"If the EU wanted to do that, it should have signed a contract with Pfizer/BioNTech saying that . . . .As it is, they were slow in ordering and their contract did not give them any say on priority. Only the Americans had a contract that allowed them to prioritise vaccine orders"
"It looks as if EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen may have got something right about the supply of #Pfizer vaccines to her member states post-Brexit. Clearly, there won’t be a further attempt to steal and impound our #AstraZeneca #Oxford vaccine."
"A single shot of either the Pfizer or Oxford vaccine provides about 80% protection against being treated in hospital, according to the latest data from the UK vaccination programme"
This is utter rubbish. You ignore that fact that a key component of the Pfizer vaccine is made in the UK and is exported to Belgium. Perhaps we should block that from happening if the EU want to play games.
The incidence of blood clots in the non-placebo arm of the Pfizer and Oxford/AZ vaccine trials were extremely low and nearly identical and both slightly lower than the placebo arms. You either believe scientific evidence  or you don’t - the Dutch govt. clearly doesn’t.
"May vaccine man o wala, kung Pfizer man 'yan o anong brand, wala pa ring kwenta ang gobyerno natin."
Only because he won't be get the Pfizer vaccine because Ursula von der Leyen won't allow it.
Pfizer made it clear that the gov had no part in vaccine development. Moderna was working on corona virus family of vaccines prior to pandemic. Trump gets no credit for the work of others this time. Warp speed was a joke with a stupid name.
"Perhaps there is a shortage of the #PfizerVaccine? Or the increase in second jabs may affect the speed of the first jab rollout, either way the targets will still be met."
Others have engaged with this but just for information to those on my timeline - you can connect the dots and guess you're getting the AZ if your appointment is at a larger vaccine hub (sports stadium etc) as they don't have the cryo fridges for Pfizer jab.
"Yes, this coming from their row with AZN - having first said the vaccine is ineffective, then effective, and now banning it despite evidence showing blood clot incidence is similar to Pfizer and far fewer than the general population.1/2"
Different reactions to diff vaccines (I got Pfizer & felt a little off  +2 thru to +5) Bear in mind any reaction is a “good thing” ... it’s your immune system fighting back 
"Just give me the covid vaccine too. I dont care whether it is sinovac, astrazeneca, pfizer, moderna or whatever. "
So excited that I was able to get my dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday! I finally can see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Belgium maufactures the Pfizer vaccine.
"#Sinovac will arrive in JB end of March. Simple 2c - 8c top loading fridge storage, two doses best given 28 days apart. Contraindicated in pregnant and lactating women and the vial must be shaken before use. These are the main differences with Pfizer’s Comirnaty vaccine"
The Way Things Are Going Sinopharm/Sputnik Will Be The Vaccines Of Choice At The Cost Of Pfizer/Astra Zeneca
The MHRA said an estimated 10.7million first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had been dished out by February 28 compared to 9.7million of the #Oxford-AstraZeneca jabIf the same 54/46 per cent split is still being used it would suggest the Pfizer figure now stands at 13.6mln
As EU FUNDED invention of BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine and UK has not a penny for its development EU has ever right to block export of BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine!

"They are no where near being met by AZ , 60 million short this quarter and told 90 million short next quarter, as far as I am aware Pfizer vaccines were not mentioned, well only by the British press"
As the UK is currently only rolling out the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines then how can there be no vaccine shortage whilst there is also a disruption to supplies?
"AZ CEO Soriot says clearly that UK Government is stopping vaccines to go to the EU.So to sum it up UK is blocking vaccines to EU.If EU was selfish nationalist it could have done the same with Pfizer, it did not, so 9 million+ people received the vaccine.You welcome."
"Now everyone scared of AZ vaccine, the EU wants to steal all the pfizes vaccine that is already contracted out to other countries , yet pfizer has more blood clots than AZ, despicable EU"
"I had my #COVID19 #AstraZeneca vaccination at #AskhamBar #York which yesterday provided its 100,000th #COVIDvaccine - a great achievement. This includes the #AstraZenecaVaccine and also the #PfizerVaccine. It's a pretty smooth operation. And I've had no ill effects since my jab."
There are no clotting issues related to the vaccine and thats the point if it was not political then the Pfizer vaccine would have also been suspended as there have actually been more blood clots with that (all within the normal range as well)
"Yeah to my understanding the majority of materials used for not only AZ but pfizer vaccine are supplied from the UK...Maybe with that 20+ grand a month pay check she gets, she could afford some common sense"
Ayo @pfizer why does the second dose of the vaccine make me feel like I drank a gallon of zzzquil #immune #sleepyaf
I disagree. They have a contract which they must fulfil. If the EU or member states buy vaccines and leaves them in the freezer that's their business.
"Patricia Donnelly giving an excellent presentation on the vaccine roll out to the @NIAHealth committee. Contingency arrangements in Northern Ireland means that a 4 week delay in the Oxford AZ supply will be mitigated by the use of Pfizer vaccine, taking the delay down to 2 weeks."

"The number of people vaccinated in Israel on January 17th was about the same as in Chile today. I think you mean that the Pfizer vaccine is ineffective, isn't it?"
"Me too.However, I am somewhat perplexed that the similar incidences of clotting disorders after the Pfizer vaccine seem to go uninvestigated & the full glare is only on AZ."
"Update: next day of second dose, arm killing me since 3am, took Panadol, got better. 22 hours from jab:  chills, extremely lethargic, slightly nauseous and out of breath. Hardly any strength to reach for the Panadol. But it’s so worth it! #PfizerVaccine"

Also component parts of the Pfizer vaccine are exported to the EU to make the vaccine.
Still don’t understand why the Pfizer vaccine has not been suspended as it has produced similar results to AZ on clotting. Something wrong here.
"Same here.  My 2nd vaccine (Pfizer) was almost 5 weeks ago.  I have one good day, then two low-energy, mostly in bed. Yesterday joint aches too. No fever."
"I got the Pfizer vaccine 2 months ago in the most random of ways .And now that I got it, i am sick worried for my family, and what kind of vaccine they’ll get, and when. Surely , what times are these?!"
Slight problem.....The lipids for the Pfizer vaccine are created in the UK. EU should start using the vaccines they’re storing before destroying the supply chain of another.
"Because it's political, pathetic grudge behaviour from EU, surely you can see that Lee, the Pfizer vaccine has equal or worse blot related deaths, not having vaccine has higher incidences still, deplorable from EU countries"
UK does Pfizer and AZ.. more pfizer vaccines were given (especially when they first started). If initial vaccine side effects seem bad - imagine an infection of Covid.

We sure are blessed to have our amazing NHS who I have seen first hand working so hard for us. #Pfizer vaccine for me so grateful  
"AZ and Pfizer set up different supply chains. Pfizer doesn't produce vaccines in the UK, AZ set up its own supply chain, specifically for the UK in the UK, and another in the EU. Are you suggesting that only the EU should be able to buy the Pfizer vaccine produced in the EU?"
You mean Brazil who rejected Pfizer’s demands they put up assets as collateral for anticipated lawsuits over COVID vaccine injuries? Brazil who has waved vaccine IP?
"I took the Pfizer one this morning with my folks. It was only available for those in my ""city"" due to the high covid numbers, low vaccine availability. We had tried to get one thru LA County & they were booked within 10 minutes. We couldn't get it on the same day."
"If you go to a mass vaccine centre or pop-up clinic, as opposed to a hospital or large GP practice which have the special deep freezes to store the Pfizer jab at -70°C, you will certainly get the OAZ jab, which is stored in fridges. You can choose which place you go to. Simples!"

"UK government claims supply problems with vaccine doses. AZ and Pfizer deny it. The truth appears to be that, if vaccinations continue at current pace there will not be sufficient doses to give second doses at 12 weeks. True to form, mismanagement disguised by lies."
But it's fine for the UK to use legal powers to get Pfizer vaccine.
It’ll be interesting to see what WHO and EMA say today. I’m also interested why govt has announced a shortage of vaccine in April and both Pfizer and AZ say this isn’t true...
It's important for those who haven't read the link that the US only uses vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.The US has not approved the AstraZeneca vaccine and are waiting until their own clinical study on American soil has been completed.

Pfizer Likely around 60~70 % effective giving higher initial efficiency against original variants though -  looks like we  will all be needing a 3rd booster shot with revised protein spike addition which easily done on mRNA and Oxford vaccines - they are working on it now !
"The EU would be justified if pfizer had a separate manufacturing facility in the UK for the UK and 1 in the EU for the EU, like AZ. If the UK then wanted vaccine from the EU facility due to issues in the UK facility, you could understand why they may block exports. Not the case."

"If there’s a shortfall with the Astra Zeneca vaccine,surely Pfizer can make it up the shortfall??"
You can choose by going to venues you know won't have access to Pfizer due to refrigeration facilities. When you book you have the option of choosing the site.I essentially chose the AZ vaccine myself that way.
"Actually, Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, Oxford, & others, were developing vaccine before Trump’s “Warp Speed”“Warp Speed” was a prog to speed vaccine production through FDA approval process. Look it up.“You are not allowed to know when Biden lies.”"

So far I just feel tired so I’m going to stay home from work. My husband had no side effects either but he had Pfizer and I had Moderna. My arm is pretty sore too. Surprisingly my arm hurts worse than when I had all my anthrax vaccines.

"AstraZeneca vaccine is safer and more practical than any other vaccine in other market , it is the media war against AstraZeneca because it is cheapest they scare the public to make them use other vaccine , AstraZeneca vaccine $3 Pfizer $35"
Odd both Astrazeneca and Pfizer say there is no problem with vaccine supply and Govt / @RobertJenrick despite his sophistry doesn't have an  explanation.
"Given a key component of the Pfizer vaccine is made in the UK, I imagine the EU can thank the UK for quite a few vaccines."
"COVID-19 vaccine: 19 allergic reactions to vaccines, mainly from Pfizer#omg"
"it is down to AZ who license the production to various sources. India doesn't own the vaccine, just like the EU doesn't own Pfizer one, these are just production sites.It depends on AZ's contracts, a bit premature to blame Indian or UK govt's"
"The UK rhetoric about vaccines has been very forebearing, surely. Its rhetoric on NIP less so, but not connected. EU saying that AZ hasn't delivered ""promised"" doses (vs ""best efforts"" in contract) is inflammatory. Suggesting seizure of UK-bound Pfizer doses is incredible."
Major component for Pfizer vaccine is exported from UK. Which is why there won’t be a vaccine export ban from EU imho
Pfizer and AstraZeneca deny the UK is facing a vaccine shortage https://f7td5.app.goo.gl/ndThTLSent via @updayUK
So far the assurance is you will get your 2nd Pfizer jab. That is probably why they have restricted vaccines to groups 1 to 9.
"Yes, I know where you're coming from, Patrizia. Pfizer were going mad because their vaccine hadn't been tested over a 12 week period. But it seems now that both vaccines give you good protection, even the 1st one. I have no time for politicians, so I always followed the science."
Pfizer and AstraZeneca say vaccine deliveries for the UK remain on track
"The EU doesn’t export any vaccines, you fool. The EU doesn’t own Pfizer and AZ."
Do you know how many people died after taking Pfizer vaccine? See this video on AstraZeneca. Blood clots are due to pre-medical condition and NOT because of AZ vaccine.
Pfizer vaccine has virtually the number of blood clot cases but they choose to try and boycott the Astra Zenaca one for purely polical reasons.
Apart from the achy arm no side effects this morning!  #PfizerVaccine #CovidVaccine
Guy be careful here. The EU is on a dangerous path. The U.K. manufactures key ingredients for the Pfizer vaccine. I know it is hard for a failed politician like you to understand basics of supply chain but this might blow up in your face! #EUbadforbusiness
"No, speak to any medic they will reassure you. Just typical political game playing. Shameful really. The Pfizer vaccine has the same % of sample as AZ, which is actually lower than the general rate of clots, vaccine or no vaccine."
UK has sent component parts of the Pfizer vaccine to the EU without which they would have no vaccine... cuts both ways
I hope that I can choose Pfizer or Astrazeneca vaccine so I could speak English fluently 
"A point not widely made in the UK yet, the Pfizer vaccine manufactured in the EU, contains a lipid product manufactured in the UK, without which their would be no vaccine! Should we limit the export of this lipid if the EU limits the export of the complete Pfizer vaccine?"

“They” haven’t. Pfizer has. They have plenty of AstraZeneca vaccines they are not using because of unfounded accusations of excess blood clotting.
"So the VA snatched me up at the hospital for the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Here is what happened: fucking nothing. For us Veterans that got the 6 shot series of ANTHRAX from the gov, we should be more worried about that Hammer dropping one day."
A lot of the initial first doses were of Pfizer; I had mine in Jan and knew of almost no one else who’d had a vaccine at that time that hadn’t had Pfizer. A lot of those first batch of second doses which are due will be for Pfizer anyway.
"Iain Dales point is valid, AstraZenica vaccine is non profit making, being sold at cost price, whereas Pfizer and others are much more expensive, and sold at a profit. He reckons those companies have lobbied various Gov. not to use AZ. As usual, follow the money, and find truth."

Great success for the U.K. I think you mean and also the ability to give supply to the covax operation giving supplies to Africa so lots to be positive about..Why do the EU want a vaccine they say is dangerous even though Pfizer has similar clot results which is not stopped.
"Because EUs vaccine problem is with AstraZeneca and not Pfizer, yet they are blocking Pfizer vaccine even though UK has no local production of that vaccine and people need to take their second doses."
Why is everyone ignoring Pfizer/Moderna? EU is receiving hundreds of millions of doses of these mRNA vaccines within weeks. Why is everyone obsessing with the AZ which is not even the major producer for the EU??
"There are complex supply chains. Thinking that Malta (population 1 million) can have a full supply chain to procure vaccines is not possible.Otherwise yes, Sanofi for example will work with J&J and Pfizer to help with that production from Q3. But this takes time."
"Yesterday,  I heard that Joe Biden said that first preference will be American Citizens in getting Vaccines ( either of Pfizer or Moderna), but India is Vaccinating the whole world instead of their own population. Think..... . This is the greatness of Veda's learning."

"As it is, Europeans have rejected AZ vaccine anyways.. good luck with your 1 million Pfizer jabs a week"
For your delectable reading. The AZ vaccine as good if not better than Pfizer on all current mutations. Stop taking nonsense through your butthole.

Untrue - my sister is a medical receptionist in Ireland and they’ve been binning ‘out of date’ Pfizer due to low take up. They’re not allowed to stray from the target groups so they bin unused vaccines. True.
Those who are quick to to say 'EU are after our vaccine'.  We had the Pfizer vaccine quickly and vaccinated over 70s. How is causing friction with EU going to help with the second doses we need ? So fed up with this country.
"Společnosti Pfizer a dalším výrobcům vakcín COVID byla udělena imunita vůči odpovědnosti za nežádoucí účinky vyplývající z podání jejich vakcín.  Pokud Vám vakcína COVID ublíží, nemůžete žalovat výrobce.What you need to know about the COVID Vaccine."
Pfizer sent also the vaccine to the EU and still we don't receive vaccines produced in the USA because Biden banned. The point is the EU didn't ban exportations but we don't receive vaccines from other parts of the world
They would also do well to remember that the Pfizer supply chain includes components made in the UK and exported to the EU - without which there would be no Pfizer vaccine.
"Yes you did ,you missed the bit where the vast majority of the Vaccines from the EU are the Pfizer one they are happy with"
