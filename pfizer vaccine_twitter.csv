You're wrong about that. The ut of anything pence deserves partial credit. He started warp speed which only helped the moderna vaccine while Pfizer did it all on it's own. Also trump never did anything he gave the job of handling the pandemic to pence so give pence gets credit
I was just reading comments on a news video about the Pfizer vaccine and there are so many people that legitimately believe it is going to cause people to turn into zombies.  Then they go on about how they are excited that they may soon be able to use their guns.
Actually trump had nothing to do with that. First he out pence in charge covid operations not himself. Second whether he funded moderna or not Pfizer wouldve came out with a vaccine as it never got government funding. Third Pence deserves the credit not trump. Biden amplified it.

It's not a horrible mess. It's an ordered exit from a pandemic. 10 jabs per 100 citizens a year since confinement is VERY GOOD.But Pfizer ingredients come from the UK. So no chance for the EU to ban exports of vaccines.If we could have we'd have vaxxed as many as US

I am so glad that you have been so careful. If everyone was as careful as you the crisis would probably be over.I got my first Pfizer vaccine shot today. The pharmacist said to expect a very sore arm for 3 or 4 days.

I am concerned about having the AZ vaccine because I have previously had a blood clot. I would much prefer to have the Pfizer one. Hopefully there will be evidence that the AZ one is safe before I have to have it.
I bet just as many people who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines experienced blood clots  (on a % basis). Nothing has proven AZ to be ineffective or dangerous.

"The data show that 12-14 days after the first dose of Pfizer, the vaccine is 92% efficacious.  The second dose gets you up to 95%.  So I'd say really 2 weeks for Pfizer."

The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have the highest efficacy at around 95 per cent.Why are we persisting with the Astra vaccine?

He didn’t even do that. The German company BioNTech had already done some research into a similar vaccine. They took that data and used it to develop the Covid vaccine in cooperation with Pfizer. That’s how they were able to develop it so soon. Trump had nothing to do with it.

Well to take it a step further the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have a higher level of adjuvent which triggers a more severe immune response. Basically designed for weak immune systems (elderly)AZ and J&J have lower levels and are designed for ppl with more normal immune systems

@JeremyVineOn5 What about Pfizer that no one seems to be mentioning. Pfizer vaccine has more or less the same numbers as Oxford AZ concerns over blood clots.
"But those remaining in the EU were stopped from using those same laws to acquire their own vaccines. Weren’t they. The EU didn’t sign contracts with us, they don’t sell us vaccines. That’s pfizer. The EU are the ones trying to stop their export. As they did with Aus."
Yes. Canada has deals with multiple companies. Pfizer vaccines were delayed due to manufacturing issues. Moderna shipped later. Astra-Zeneca *just* got approved and is arriving. Johnson & Johnson is approved but hasn’t shipped to us yet. We have no deals for vaccines from China.

Israel leading world with National EHR played significant role here. Provided needed data for Pfizer & made it easier to ID who received vaccine.
"I am still reading through much of the literature on strain B.1.351. For Pfizer and Moderna, it is very easy to add new mRNA strains to their vaccines that produce a broad spectrum immunity. These ""multi-valence"" vaccines should be available by fall-winter 2021."
@pfizer news today that you’re talking about profiteering from the vaccine once the pandemic is declared technically over. This talk being outed publicly whilst the pandemic is still ongoing and many countries are going back into another lockdown is disgraceful. Shame on you.
It is not a vaccine. It's immune therapy. They need to tell the truth and everyone needs to research the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA websites in detail.  They aren't even approved yet!!
On the plus side Pfizer will probably be supplying a gift bag with each shot of vaccine plus entry into a prize draw next year.

No. I had the Pfizer vaccine and was very fortunate. The arm was not sore either. How bout you ?
And we just resoundingly elected a Labor government so we deserve all the Pfizer vaccine we can get 
Don't people understand how lucky we are a vaccine  exists and that we have access to it. All this jabber about wanting the Pfizer in preference to the Astra-Zeneca vaccine is like getting onto a lifeboat from the Titanic then complaining you don't have window seat.

You are aware that a key ingredient for the Pfizer vaccine is produced and exported from UK to EU ?
"Epidemic disease expert Dr Adam Levine, an Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at Brown University, explains to us how the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine works, and discusses all the important details of the immunisation."
It was more like government help. They gave more money to moderna to help create the vaccine faster. Pfizer never had that funding.
That’s not true the EU has exported vaccines if they hadn’t how come I had the Pfizer vaccine in the uk it’s not manufactured here
"On March 18, Pfizer‘s Judy Sewards and Sandra Amaro will be joining discussions on clinical trial diversity and vaccine confidence at #RealChemSXSW. Register to attend virtually. #SXSW #PFEColleague"

"I had both doses of the Pfizer vaccine, no problems whatsoever!"
What’s with the hardon over Pfizer not receiving research funding? There’s 2 other vaccines available in the US.  Who paid for that research??Who paid for all vaccine manufacturers to expand manufacturing facilities?Who used the DPA to prioritize Mfg??
He did the opposite. Canada was widely panned for ordering enough vaccines for 9 doses per person from 7 different companies. Many other Western countries did the same but Canada did it first. Canada was first to sign contract with Moderna and 4th with Pfizer.

"Sputnik V is the fourth COVID-19 vaccine to secure emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, coming after Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac."
Lots of research and common sense. It works well. Just look back at the older press conferences you'll see they talk about funding and helping moderna create a vaccine not Pfizer. That's the reality of this situation.
"#Moderna  and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines trigger strong immune responses in pregnant or breastfeeding women, equivalent to that of other women of reproductive age, preliminary research shows. @casereport2"
"How is the EU going to claim they send doses from a private company.It's almost like the EU(and someone from pfizer) claimed it wasn't effective for certain age groups.""scratch our back otherwise we're blocking vaccine exports"" how very benevolent of our EU 'gods' huh?"
mama will receive her first dose of pfizer vaccine today  sana po maging ok and walang serious side effects 
"Geert Vanden Bossche is a real expert and finally telling the truth about ALL of these vaccines! Not just the AstraZeneca/Pfizer. #Fauci is not and expert, #Gates is not an expert, @GregHuntMP is NOT an expert! Link to a video EVERYONE needs to watch."
"35 years after leaving Hungary to pursue mRNA research at @Penn, biochemist & @BioNTech_Group Senior VP @kkariko received her first dose of @pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. Her work pioneered the science behind the vaccines being given to millions this year!"
I will just wait for the novavax now. It’s seems like the general public aren’t good enough to be given the Pfizer vaccine.
"@VinGuptaMD just spoke w/ my son, my 5yo grandson exposed to COVID at school today.He normally wears mask, hope so today. trying to see if COVID+ child did? I’m at risk vulnerable 67yo, had first Pfizer vaccine, 37 yo son fully vaccinated, his wife 1st Pfizer. What should we do?"
"The vaccine clinic at my surgery has been suspended for 2 weeks, their Pfizer vaccines were cancelled on 24 hour notice,all appointments had to be cancelled. Its pointless of Paul Reid quoting these figures. He should tell people whats really happening"
But the UK exports lipids to Pfizer in EU which are critical to production of their vaccine i.e. UK is reciprocating - just seems EU either doesn't know it - or doesn't want you to know so it can continue to feed a gullible public the line that Brexit is bad
Covid vaccine technology pioneer: 'I never doubted it would work'Katalin Karikó’s mRNA research helped pave way for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s successful work
. @paulkrugman seems to have missed the piece were:- Europeans developed 3 working vaccines vs just 1 for US- US supplies for Pfizer + J&J dependent on EU- EU played fair by allowing millions of vaccines & intermediate products to be exported while Yanks/Brits block everything
Pfizer didn't take federal funding for their vaccine.
"Early studies in Israel are showing the Pfizer vaccine can drop transmission rate by around 90% but you know, it’s chill"
"No - lets continue the Pfizer roll out, suspend the AZ roll out, improve quarantine and obtain more effective vaccines.It's not that hard - just need enough people to pressure the government and not simply roll over and accept their shit"
"@normanswan do you know if people who have had blood clots before or adverse reactions to vaccines or both, will be able to avail themselves of Pfizer, regardless of their demographic?"
"Is there anything the federal govt gets right?Pfizer coronavirus vaccine doses wrongly delivered to Perth instead of Adelaide, delaying SA rollout - ABC News"
"A shipment of Pfizer vaccine doses destined for South Australia has been wrongly delivered to Western Australia, causing delays to the state's rollout. https://ab.co/2Nvyo8K #perthnews #perth #abcperth"
"Again I ask, explain how the delay in accessing COVID vaccines is “all the fault of the current liberal government. 100%.” When you consider:- Double the needed was quickly ordered from Pfizer and Moderna- New vaccines take time to ramp up the speed to produce them-There are"
"“Hey can you let me know when we can get those 100,000,000 more Pfizer vaccines?” #Vaccination #biden #bidenrules"
"Remind everyone Pfizer have an under used facility at Sandwich, Kent. Make vaccines there, no political interference in who gets it."
"Covax has said that the West Bank and Gaza would get about 240K doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, and 37K doses of Pfizer vaccine, but these have not yet arrived."
If you love slose to one of the big vaccine centres it may be the case and may make flexibility easier.I live in a semi-rural area and it's all being done a doctors surgeries here. I believe 1 is AstraZenica and one is Pfizer.
"#Europe: #EU: #COVID19 #vaccine contracts signed with #Curevac#AstraZeneca#Sanofi-GSK#Janssen Pharmaceutica NV#Biontech-Pfizer,#Moderna?Only #Pfizer & #AstraZeneca are actually delivering NOW IN THE EU. This is a success not a problem."
"Didn’t see the interview, but I have had both Pfizer vaccines with no side effects."
What benefits? The stockpile that wasn’t there? The 200 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine (that his administration put no funding into) he didn’t buy that were sorely needed? The outright denial that there was a pandemic? The absolute lack of plan/response to stop the spread?
"Remind Pfizer they have an underused facility in Sandwich, Kent.Produce vaccines there, no political interference"

It appears this affects those who have the AstraZeneca vaccine rather than the Pfizer dose. I have no idea why – ask a scientist'.
Really...how about increase of stroke patients after receiving Covid vaccine...is anyone addressing this critical issue. My sister suffered massive stroke after first dose of covid pfizer vaccine...her neighbor in rehab as well!!!
Pfizer has similar numbers linked to blood clotting.. Yet no suspension Amazing that these blood clotting incidents linked to the AZ vaccine have only occurred in European countries..
Good job! Get Pfizer vaccines available and I will get mine! (due to medical conditions) TY
" no, just the vaccine."
Thank you #UAE to provide us with a vaste choice of vaccines  Endlessly grateful #Pfizer
Please give some credit to President Trump.  Let's be fair he did an incredible job. Pfizer had the vaccine 3 weeks before the election and never announced it .  If this was made public you would still be in your basement !
.. what is it with these #GOPCanada quislings every time the *actual prime minister  scores .. first @erinOToole conferenced with the #Pfizer CEO (he wasn't) - now @FordNation's been personally bugging Biden for Vaccines (he hasn't) .. where are the butterfly nets? #RubeNation
"Now this is also a bit of FOMO scaremongering... Pfizer vaccines are purchased for up to 7.5 million. Given the low rate of vaccination and upcoming supplies, there should be enough for half the population (remaining gets Astra)."
"Around 12,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been wasted due to errors by staff.In late January the HSE confirmed that 22 vials – equating to 130 doses – of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine could not be used after they were incorrectly stored.#vaccines"
Covid-19 vaccines: Moderna vs. Pfizer vs. Johnson & Johnson comparison - http://syracuse.com
must read article on the pfizer so called vaccine
"We were the first country in the world to approve and receive shipments of the Pfizer Vaccine. 3rd to approve moderna and 4th country to receive shipments of the moderna vaccine.Not sure where you've been watching, but it's not something tied to reality."
"Also you're talking about the AstraZeneca vaccine. Even I gave concerns about that and I'm waiting for more articles to get released, but so far they have found no link between the vaccine and blood clotting. Pfizer, j&j and Moderna are all still perfectly safe."
"The efficacy (effectiveness) is higher for Moderna & Pfizer. & in a lot of cases, less risky. Because you're not getting an adenovirus (weakened/deadened) form of the virus. The Moderna & Pfizer mRNA vaccine is like an email to your body on how to kill an invader.Caylee ARNP"
"I wanted to get the Pfizer vaccine cuz, you know, Viagra."
When a vaccine becomes available to me I will consent to Astra Zeneca but I would prefer Pfizer.
"If you don't place at least some of the blame to the government, then I don't know. A lot of this would be different if they were able to secure those January Pfizer vaccines"
"RG support Pfizer and ultimately Pfizer because it can be used as a common vaccine for all countries as it is highly adaptive to temperature changes, formula of storage capacity is high, i believe, but expensive, so it should be like, upper class and cronies should pay the rest!"
Why not ban this vaccine and use the Pfizer one which has done wonders in Israel
@JustinTrudeau time for preexisting health issues to be taken to account at 70 year olds to get a Pfizer vaccine. Not one that will cause blood clots in a weakened heart.
Looking at the VAERS data the J+J (Janssen) vaccine certainly appears to have less danger than Moderna and Pfizer so far. Reported stats as of today. If anyone has data on number of doses given per each manufacturer please share. I have not found a good tracker for that yet.
"I had no effects at all from either vaccine #1 or #2 (#Pfizer). Got the second one yesterday. No issues today. In fact, I played tennis tonight! @VinGuptaMD is still my hero when it comes to vaccines. He was on @MSNBC again tonight. Anti-vaxxers need to listen to him."
"Ingen tvivl. Mit første valg ville være: #Pfizer. Men jeg erkender, at jeg nok ikke får et valg. #sundpol #vaccine #COVID19dk"
