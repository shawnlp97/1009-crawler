"come to Germany to see „not working“. For most people no access so far even to the Biontech (distributed by Pfizer) vaccine, that was invented in our own country. The EU/ our government totally fucked up."
"Got my first Pfizer vaccine on February 1st and my second on my birthday, February 22nd.  Slight symptoms but relieved to be vaccinated."
"I came out of retirement as a nurse to help vaccinated my community.  The site where I'm working is only giving the Pfizer vaccine, but honesty I encourage everyone to say yes to whatever vaccine is available."
you get the vaccine yet? I got dose #1 of Pfizer today :) dose #2 shall be on 10 April 2021 :)
sell vaccines to them? are we private producers like pfizer moderna J&J?  what are you talking about  the peace agreements were conducted behind the scenes years before the covid and signed before the vaccines were made
Leaked Documents Reveal Major Concerns About Early Batches of Pfizer mRNA Vaccine :
"My understanding is that the J&J vaccine has the same operative principle of delivering mRNA for the endogenous production of spike protein like Moderna and Pfizer, but uses a modified adenovirus instead of a lipid bubble. So it shouldn't surprise me if reactions were the same."
The Pfizer Chinese virus vaccine is 95% effective. The annual flu vaccine is 70%. The flu is more dangerous. Why are we being told to wear mask after vacation?
"I think we have to be careful about the term vaccine hesitance - It isnt vaccine hesitance so much as genuine concern based on data. The message ""take whatever vaccine you get"" is problematic if LTCs are offered pfizer but frontline brown PSWs (often women) are offered AZ"
Fantastic! I got my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine today!
"It's regarding the Pfizer vaccine (made in Belgium, a plant that we actually paid to refurbish because the EIB wouldn't do so).  AZ vaccines are made domestically with some inflow from India's SII (but not to any timetable)."
"Then why is the Pfizer vaccine's efficacy data from US, Germany, SA, Turkey, Brazil and Argentina not considered enough to predict efficacy in Indians? What was the scientific rationale of demanding bridging study, which reportedly was why Pfizer withdrew Indian application? (2)"
"SMDH, Bill Gates, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson as well as the other Pharmaceutical and Drug Companies along with its investors is going to profit big off of the Coronavirus Vaccine hysteria."
"The boy in the yellow shirt, BioNTech CEO Dr Uğur Şahin, will go on to invent the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine along with his wife, Özlem Türeci. Yesterday they received Germany’s highest honour - the Order of Merit - for the fast development of their Covid-19 vaccine."
"Update on the second Pfizer vaccine - I  was expecting to, but never got any side effects! I got it done Thursday AM & still feel completely normal! "
"The vaccination site at the Tampa Greyhound Track had more than 1,000 doses of vaccine go unused Saturday. The site has 2,000 Pfizer doses available and 500 Johnson & Johnson doses. Today, the site administered 1,470 shots."
"So? According to their donor list they've received donations from hundreds of pharma companies.  How does Pfizer benefit from being a donor? If their vaccine is effective, who gives a shit? The CDC has no say in the granting of FDA approval for vaccines or any drugs."
"COVID-19: Science behind Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be used to give people cancer jabs 'within a couple of years', says co-creator"
"Hmm. I'm wondering how it would be ""too much"" mRNA if getting the 2 full doses of the moderna is considered fine(28 days bt doses). Do you both mean too much mRNA in the sense that they received the moderna vaccine on the schedule of what's recommended for the Pfizer? 21 days?"
"""...one dose of the Pfizer vaccine was 57% to 61% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after 4 weeks and that the AstraZeneca vaccine was 60% to 73% effective.""  AZ more effective than Pfizer after 1st shot."
I’m going into my third week of migraine headaches since the first Pfizer vaccine. I’m really reconsidering the second.
"The missus got the Pfizer vaccine today in Minnesota,hit her hard with nausea,headache joint pain and very sore arm..wish I could send her some flowers but tomorrow is Sunday there.."
Yeah... That's why I waited longer to take the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna one
"Ah, now I see it.. why the serum institute guy is all over the place.. if Pfizer is allowed to make vaccine in India, poonawala’s vaccine monopoly will end !"
"New data: The number of adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine has more than doubled, increasing by 103.76% standing at a total of 100,809. And the number of adverse reactions to the Oxford vaccine has increased by a whopping 985.66% to a total of 228,337."
"COVID-19: Science behind Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be used to give people cancer jabs ‘within a couple of years’, says co-creator | World News"
Sore arm after the second Pfizer vaccine.
"Frank A. D'Amelio, CFO & executive VP of global supply for Pfizer, said the company anticipates a ""significant opportunity"" for its vaccine ""from a pricing perspective"" as we move ""from a pandemic situation to an endemic situation."" Hmmm."
"I will never administer the Indian vaccine.  If ever I did, which I very much doubt, it would be Chinese or Russian vax only. Pfizer too would be the last option."
"i myself have j&j, which is a great one-shot vaccine to have as variants continue to rise.  once you're eligible, get the vaccine! j&j, moderna, pfizer, it doesn't matter - what matters more is that you get inoculated to protect yourselves and others"
"New data: the number of adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine has more than doubled, increasing by 103.76% standing at a total of 100,809. And the number of adverse reactions to the Oxford vaccine has increased by a whopping 985.66% to a total of 228,337."

Got my first Pfizer vaccine today!
"Ugur Sahin, whose company BioNTech developed one of the first vaccines in the fight against COVID-19 with Pfizer, told the Welt Am Sonntag newspaper that he believed the latest shutdowns would be the last."
"I had NO REACTION to either dose. I had the Pfizer vaccine. The only issue was a slight soreness at the injection site. No fatigue, no sore throat or headache.  Had my second one last Wednesday."
Yes but we received Astrazeneca much later.   if they waited for it to arrive then she would’ve look like they deliberately sidestepped Pfizer - and there is specific vaccine skepticism against the “new and untested” mRNA vaccines.
My parents and grandma were find after their second Pfizer vaccines. My brother and I both had pretty bad symptoms after our second Moderna shots.
"... and the phishing emails about ""winning a Pfizer/Moderna vaccine appointment"" have started."
Okay so who else got their Pfizer vaccine and then their arm felt like they got punched by The Incredible Hulk himself?
"Pfizer CEO and Chairman, Albert Bourla, doesn't plan to get the jab from his own company, says that he's 59 and in good health.  Wow.  Refusing the vaccine from his own company"
Got my 2nd Pfizer vaccine yesterday.  I didn’t feel any side effects until almost 30 hours later when I suddenly became super tired. I laid down for a bit and ended up taking a 4 hour nap!  Now I feel great.
I think asking marginalised women to risk a few cases of cvst for the greater good is not a great ask :( . I agree we http://should.be offered pfizer or moderna. Vaccine tiering is an equity concern.
I got the Pfizer vaccine. The first shot. I’ll be getting the second one March 29th.  And does she mean what are the reasons why I chose to get the vaccine?  My only side effects were a sore arm and a high fever. But I was fine in less than day after.
"""It is the most capitalist / structurally racist thing [if] the vaccines available to you are SES-predictable"" esp knowing what we know about varying efficacies for AZ and J&J as compared to pfizer or moderna. Do not chalk up BIPOC concerns about this to vaccine hesitance."
First dose done. # Biontech #PfizerVaccine
". Xi properly inoculated either Moderna or Pfizer !  Xi would say, their vaccines are of highest quality on Earth, & must be reserved for export to friendly nations ! .  These are their typical expert lies e.g.  opium grown as revolutionary opium   huge defeat as Long March ! ."
"I officially get my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine  for one more step closer to being in the stands with @SacRepublicFC, &  @SomosUnikos. "
"I was wondering about that. I have elderly family members who want to get the Pfizer vaccine, they are over 70, but there is utter silence on getting this particular vaccine, they are pushing the Astra.zen..."
"EH TAPI YA TAPI   IN WHICH OF SPEAKING  My supervisor when i was an intern said that just a lil bit of vaccine is halal And i asked her, then how much?  She said that it was just 4 (it was january of 2020, we don't count sinovac pfizer and others halal vaccine that just released)"
Was in the Pfizer vaccine study for what it’s worth! Vaccinated since august 2020 
Operation Warp Speed had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with the development of ANY COVID VACCINES. Not Pfizer’s. Not Moderna’s. Not Johnson & Johnson’s. Democrats delayed no PPP funding. Trump sabotaged our response at every step and killed countless Americans. You are a disgrace.
"There really isn’t a difference between Pfizer and Moderna.  I got my first Moderna last Monday, I would have preferred J&J to get it over in one shot, but wanted to start the vaccine process as soon as I could find a vaccine."
Got my first dose of the vaccine Pfizer. Arm is very sore and no side effects yet.
if i finally get some luck-the pfizer vaccine dose Walgreens requested will show up tomorrow & even luckier would be if he could get it $ be home in time to go to work @ 1:00 pm-not planning on any luck - since i have pit more than 40 hrs into this vaccine saga-not counting on it
I’ve got my first Pfizer vaccine scheduled for Monday.
"I got the Pfizer vaccine on March 8th.  Felt horrible the next day with chills, headache and awful shooting pain in my spine.  Glad I didn't work next day.  I hope 2nd vaccine 3/29 won't be as bad.  Boss gave me 3/30-4/1 off.  Phew!"
"My 86-y-old mother got the J&J vaccine; my husband has gotten his 1st dose of Moderna, and I got my 1st dose of Pfizer—we’re all ecstatic!"
Got my 2nd dose of the #Pfizer vaccine Thursday. It was 2 days of agony but I feel so much better now PLUS I have the relief of knowing that in 2 weeks I can go outside again. #WearAMask #SociallyDistance #EndWhiteSupremacy #StopAsianHate #BlackLivesMatter
It is irresponsible to block any exports of vaccines and it’s ingredients. Blocks are not helpful to eradicate Corona virus worldwide. Lives above profits! #Pfizer #AstraZeneca #COVID19Vaccine @jensspahn @vonderleyen
"Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine is fast to make, but complex steps—like enveloping the mRNA with fat needed for its transport—can create production bottlenecks"

Pfizer
"A lot of people are saying that they instead should have received the AZ vaccine instead of Pfizer, to ‘ go to the same one as the rest of us’. Well we received stock of AZ much later. If they did this it would’ve looked like they deliberately sidestepped Pfizer. The problem:"
What about printing that @GOVUK plan to block sending ingredients needed for the Pfizer vaccine to the EU  #ToryCorruption #ToryHypocrisy #ScottishIndependence #BothVotesSNP
I have had 2 Pfizer vaccines. I had no problems with either one. Thankful to have had them.
What does this even mean? The Pfizer Biontech vaccine uses mRNA technology that has been around for a decade. They took no US development funds. Moderna is also mRNA based while J&J is based on adenovirus.
"I received the 1st dose of Pfizer Feb 17th, but tested positive for COVID March 3rd. 1st symptoms showed Feb 25th 1:30 a.m. So the vaccine had only been in my system 8 days. Was treated with monoclonal infusion March 5th. Can't get another vaccine for 90 days."
"Pfizer notably did not accept government money to develop, test or expand manufacturing capacity under Trump’s Operation Warp Speed. Pfizer partnered with the vaccine’s original developer, Germany’s BioNTech, in March. Operation Warp Speed was in May.” https://yourvalley.net/stories/ap-fact-check-trump-wrongly-takes-full-credit-for-vaccine,200950…"
"So sorry for your your losses A.D. and your experience with the virus.  Glad you got well and now have received the vaccine!!!  I got my first Pfizer shot today, but will still follow all mitigations in hopes of getting rid of the virus in the US."

@AstraZeneca @pfizer @SKyriakidesEU @vonderleyen @IrishTimes @rtenews So we can stop exports to the EU? Which will stop Pfizer Vaccine production in the EU. Not thought this through? We aren't practicing VACCINE NATIONALISM like the EU @BBCWorld @abcnews
"Very slow speed of vaccination , looking like @MoHFW_INDIA not taking this seriously , ministry should allow @pfizer @moderna_tx vaccines."
"We have an announcement for that much Pfizer. Forgive me for being cynical, but given we’re currently behind the scheduled rollout by around 3.75 million people can you blame me?   By the time most people are able to access any vaccine Scotty’s photo-op will be long forgotten."

Yes. I got the 2 Pfizer vaccines. I’m 72 and had no side effects whatsoever. Feeling great.
"For the sake of clarity, the vaccines should be referred to as a Pfizer & Pfizer, a Moderna & Moderna, or a Johnson."
"Exactly 2 weeks ago I got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and today, I get to say I am now FULLY VACCINATED! An entire year in the making and a day I never thought would come. So incredibly grateful to be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel"
Hello I got the Pfizer vaccine at 9:30 this morning and then I worked a whole shift at busy restaurant I currently am feeling like absolute garbàge
@jairbolsonaro I didn’t turn into a crocodile when I got @pfizer vaccine
"I got both doses of Pfizer & only had a sore arm and was tired for a day. I think is great, innovative technology that could really change the course of future vaccines!"
