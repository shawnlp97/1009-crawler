"Looks like New Zealand has dropped the AstraZ/Oxford vaccine, in favor of Pfizer."
Dat 95% effectiveness tho.
I'm guess it has more to do with the South African variant and other future varieties that can in part evade the immune system.
We ever hear any concrete evidence one way or the other on if the variants can evade current vaccines?
In vitro I think that there is evidence that Oxford isn't considerably less effective. However it may be simply that the Oxford vaccine takes longer to be fully effective.
"In vivo, where it counts, I'm not certain if anybody knows."
Well South Africa is at least so certain that they sold their AZ doses to Australia the African Union. Edited

Here is the pre print of the study from a ZA University (WITS) https://www.wits.ac.za/covid19/covid19-news/latest/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-results.html
"From the article, they are selling to the African Union (AU), not Australia."
Thanks
"They sold it to the African Union, not Australia."
Korea sold their's to Taiwan lol.
"There is literally no evidence that any variant evades any kind of immunity at all. Just vague implications that one or more might, mainly by news agencies worried about people stopping tuning in for covid updates"
Yes. There was a study on Astra Zeneca in relation to the South african mutant.  It was only 10% effective in reducing mild and moderate infections.
"Is that actually bad? Isn't ""mild to moderate"" covid-19 as bad as a cold? How does it perform against severe covid illness?"
"The trial group was relatively small and consisted of young, healthy people. So there was no data to draw any conclusions regarding severe disease."
"That is the problem, among the studied groups there were not enough severe cases to give any significant answers (was 2000 people in total). They hope that it does help to reduce severe cases but that is about it, hope."
"10% effectiveness isn't enough to stop the virus before it mutates significantly again. Also mild and moderate covid can cause long term health problems. Also, like others here have already said, nothing can be said about effectiveness against severe infections yet"
"Well shit, that’s concerning. What about the mRNA ones?"
I don't think the mRNA ones have been studied against mild Covid at all (it was specifically excluded from the trials).
I’m in the moderna clinical trial and we get tested for covid every visit. We also report it to the trial immediately if we develop any signs of infection even if they’re mild symptoms.
So how long until you find out if your were actually vaccinated?
I found out last month that I was vaccinated last summer!
"They are doing fine, as far as I am aware. Only slightly reduced."
"I don't believe they actually ran human studies though, unlike Oxford. Correct me if I'm wrong though."
"It was an observational study of in total 2000 people (one group vaccinated, one group not). So yeah humans, but they did not intentionally infect + the groups were young and healthy, so not enough severe cases to get to meaningful conclusions."
How effective was it in reducing deaths and severe cases?
Zero people who have gotten the AstraZeneca vaccine have died of COVID
Zero people who have gotten the AstraZeneca vaccine have died of COVID
"That isn't true, of course. The vaccines are great, but in real world use some vaccinated people still die of the disease. The UK has been using AZ for long enough to have seen some of them, just like Israel has seen about 150 deaths of people who had received two doses of Pfizer (though many of them might have been infected before their second dose)"
"The sample was too small to answer that question. It was only 2000 people. They still hope it prevents severe cases but since it did basically nothing to prevent infection that is just that, hope."
it's also because of supply issues w/ astrazenneca and the fact that all the other vaccines haven't even gotten regulatory approval from pharmac  medsafe yet.
this'll bring the goal of everyone vaccinated by the end of 2021 closer in sight
It’s not Pharmac that approves meds. Pharmac does the funding. It’s MedSafe.
"You can't really compare like that though. AZ tested all members of the trial on a regular basis and therefore picked up asymptomatic cases. If they're all available at the same time, by all means get Pfizer or Moderna... But if you have to decide been AZ now and taking your chances of getting sick until another is available, you're better off with AZ."
Wrong mindset.
EDIT: I guess I should clarify this.
Holding out for a vaccine and not taking one which is available is the wrong mindset. The aim of mass vaccination is to drive the r0 low enough that the virus starts to sputter out. People holding on or “feeling” cheated because of a vaccine does not have the highest efficiency is the wrong mindset.
You should take what is available especially since they all prevent severe illness and deaths so it seems.
"If it turns out you need a booster every year like with the flu, then you can be more selective if you want but this idea one is better than the other in the overall picture IS the wrong mindset."
Yooo I though it was just me who could feel the exact 19.73% effectiveness difference!!!!
I’m going to assume this is sarcasm lol.
"It is, lol"
I forgot to add the /s
"I'm very excited to get vaccinated, tbh and i don't care which one i get"
"Pfizer measured the effectiveness with only symptomatic people unlike the Oxford/Astra which included asymptomatic people, the Oxford/Astra vaccine is on par if not better than the Pfizer one."
Results from Scottish vaccinations so far show Pfizer doing a whole 10% worse than AZ

Vaccines causes senior citizens.
Vaccines made my mom get all grey and wrinkly!!
Why did I originally think this comment was some crazy anti vaxxer that genuinely thought that taking a vaccine would turn you into an old man instantly.
Man I'm dumb lol
"It’s a horrible disease, really. Slow acting. I watched my vaccinated father age from a 60 year old man to a 70 year old man all in the course of maybe 10 years"
My lawn. OFF! NOW!
"I can assure you all, after receiving my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I still do not have super powers.  Kind of disappointing"
But are you now gay?
No because he's not a frog
Must be super annoying for the BioNTech scientists that developed the vaccine that it's now always their producers and clinical trials support that gets all the fame.
"I read a BBC article yesterday where they said ""the BioNTech vaccine, distributed by pfizer"" and I think that's a very fair way to call it"
"Wish this was how they handled it more, around the world."
"Same with using people's names in all headlines. If you're gonna write about them, use their names in a way that when it gets shared, people read their name."
You mean to tell me you don’t like: “Georgia man discovers this 1933 ford”!?
Is this a click bait title...  you won't believe what he found in the trunk...
Then they try to make you click next page 39 times to tell you he found some woman's lost wedding ring or something
And it's not even a Ford but some 1973 Chevrolet
Here in Germany I've never heard it being called the Pfizer vaccine. It's always been BioNTech.
Well you should also add Germany to the name since they publicly funded quite a portion of the research. 375 million EUR isn't exactly pocket change.
That's BTW quite ridiculous part of science - lot of it is public funded but results often end up in private journal that is reviewed for free by scientists funded publicly.
No wonder everyone uses SciHub.
Pfizer just rolls off the tongue easier than BioNTech especially for non English speaking languages. It’s a shame
"This is surprising to me, because I (lifelong English speaker) was just recently thinking that if nobody had told me how to say it, Pfizer would be a very strange word to figure out how to say."
"It’s strange to try to read it in English. But if you wrote it in another language, the annoying silent P disappear and it becomes much easier to pronounce!"
"I think that ""BioNtech-Pfizer vaccine"" would be a good way to describe it. It's compact in its wording and still emphasizes the relationship between the two companies."
I’ve heard it referred to exactly like this from a few news outlets
In Finland it's referred to as BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine which I think is simple and it works.
"It takes them both for this to work. BioNTech might have had the technology, but they would have never had the production and distribution capabilities that Pfizer does. While obviously not often to this scale, this kind of “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” deal is incredibly common in pharma. Also, I doubt the heads of BioNTech mind that much. They became multibillionaires overnight."
"Sure but it most definitely doesn't make it ""Pfizer's vaccine"" as the headline says. Imagine calling calling every product sold through amazon as ""Amazon's X"" because they do the distribution, or calling it the Foxxcon's iPhone because they do the manufacturing. It makes no sense."
"I work in pharma for a medium sized company, we have licensed a couple drugs we have developed to a large company (at phase III exactly like this vaccine) and both are referred exclusively by that companies name.  No one here cares, that’s just how it’s done."
"Up until recently I kept seeing both companies mentioned, but now everywhere I see this latest story it’s just Pfizer. Although the article references Biontech in the first paragraph."

"It usually depends on where the article is from. The US calls it ""the Pfizer vaccine"", German news call it ""the BioNTech vaccine"", most others seem to go with some combination."
"All German news-channel regulated by the government call it the ""BioNTech-Pfizer"" vaccine. ARD/ZDF/1Live and all local editions use both company names."
"On a sidenote, Poland refuses to even openly acknowledge that a German company contributed to the vaccine and  only talk about how America is bringing them the end of the pandemic."
Polish guy here. Our current government is indeed truly fucked up.
I'm increasingly worried about Poland becoming more and more fascist to be honest.
"I noticed. As someone with Polish ancestors, watching Polish news gives me headachs. Lets hope the younger generations will fix it before its too late."
"Even in Germany it is mostly refered to ""BioNTech and Pfizer Vaccine"""
"Yup, I've seen it called ""Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine"" in our news (Finland)."
"truthfully I think it is a case where we know the name Pfizer and oddly enough of the 2, that is the one easier to pronounce. people are lazy, why use 2 names when you can use one? which one? the one that rolls off your tongue."
So one more million on top of what we were supposed to get in those two months? Fall semester in person seems to be a real possibility after all
I would bet large sums on money on fall semester being in person. Canada should hit max vaccination sometime in June which leaves plenty of time for error before September
I agree! Now the provinces need to get their shit together and get it in arms.
"I can tell you, in Quebec at least, the problem is human resources. Right now the vaccination teams have some people working 14 hour days, 7 days a week."
"They apparently have plans in place to hire and train more people quickly, as more doses arrive."
This will be quite a challenge.
