"If you gave 10 million people actual covid you would expect somewhere in the region of 70,000 of them to die. The balance of risk is so massively in favour of the vaccine it blows my mind that countries have actually paused their rollout to investigate a handful of potential adverse reactions. It's almost criminal."
Even higher if you factor in the age of the people that have had the vaccine so far.

"Johnson & Johnson is unknown in regards to this efficacy, but it is not similar to Moderna/Pfizer, and so it is probably likely that it's efficacy is low like the AstraZeneca in this regard too, either way we don't know so better not to take a chance with it.This is a pretty illiterate statement considering that J&J is a 1 shot vaccine.Furthermore being 60 % efficient at stopping infection does not mean that you are totally only 60 % less likely to transmit."
