What happened to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? @CPHO_Canada @JustinTrudeau @BogochIsaac @celliottability
I want his johnson and johnson vaccine. 
"If the Johnson and Johnson vaccine doesn't include their signature ingredient, Asbestos, I don't want it."
Johnson and Johnson vaccine only 66% effective. Moderna me please
USA will bail Canada out! Johnson and Johnson vaccines and some Doritos.
"I went to a mass vaccination event last week in NC, very few POC, it was a Pfizer vaccine event - at Johnson C. Smith a few miles away (a Black college), there was a Johnson and Johnson vaccine event, I don't think the disparity is accidental"
I went to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine at @valenciacollege this morning but they don’t have it and they are not sure when they’ll have more.
Those vaccines aren’t approved in the US and by the time they are (a month or more from now) we won’t need them because Pfizer/Moderna/Johnson and Johnson production will be close to having enough doses for every adult in the US.
Got my  Johnson and Johnson vaccine today arm hurt for three minutes I feel like I have energy and I don’t know if this is from the shot or just feel good about getting it! 
An obvious question for you is what of the Pfizer Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines? All provoke immunity in the same way by production of the spike protein. Trying to remember where I read in UK 1 Pfizer case and 2 Astrazeneca cases of CVT. Must be some in the USA?
"The U.K. only has two sites in the country producing vaccines. Both belong to Astra Zeneca and are contracted to supply the U.K. first. The EU has many sites by comparison, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and AstraZeneca."
We expect to see a big difference in our supply in April once we get more of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. -@SecMandyCohen

My Mom and I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today! One and done! Thank you @CarlosGSmith for all the information you provided. You are the reason we were able to get it in our home today.  #COVID19Vaccination #JohnsonAndJohnson
The other thing to consider is whether you want to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. It is not an mRNA type vaccine but was developed using traditional techniques used in the development of a number of other long-standing vaccines. It also only requires a single dose 
"As Fauci said, the Johnson and Johnson study on the African variant showed the current vaccine wasnt effective on it. This variant has already been found in over 17 states. Its also closing in on Rands Kentucky"
I may be getting the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine today. Waiting to hear from the dr.
Received my Johnson and Johnson vaccine yesterday. Today I have a ton of side effects but one day of side effects is better than covid
Absolutely not you. You never hear of any other vax being knocked. Remember Johnson and Johnson & others have yet to be approved! It harms vaccine confidence and exta deaths through covid because of it.
"Astra Zeneca is far more effective than the Johnson and Johnson vaccine however, the former is being withheld in many European countries due to some isolated cases of side effects."
"I'm a week and a day out from getting Johnson and Johnson vaccine.  I had ZERO side effects. In 6 more days I will be 2 weeks out and then I'll feel safer than I have in a year of hermit living.  I'm so grateful for hope.  I'll still wear mask but I'm not as ""terrorized"" now."
59k doses are expected to be delivered to Rhode Island next week. Johnson and Johnson vaccine doses are expected increase across the state. About 16k doses will be available weekly at the end of the month.
I am 68 years old and I just want to know where is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
"Unfortunately not, I can't have any mRNA technology vaccines as they are known to cause anaphylaxis in Mast Cell patients. I had hoped she'd agree to the Johnson and Johnson one, but she said no, it's still a risk as I am having unexplained throat swelling and histamine bruising"
"My uncle got unexpectedly vaccinated today with Johnson and Johnson's. He was supposed to get vaccinated tomorrow but he left today to see the location and the doctor luckily gave him the chance to get the vaccine. 2 downs of my family being vaccinated, one down (me) to get it."

Johnson and Johnson not a American based company? That’s the majority vaccine administered to Norway no?
"BREAKING: @GovParsonMO and @HealthyLivingMo announce a Mega Vaccine Site at St. Louis Community College at Forest Park. This will be the first state run event in the city limits. March 25 + 26 - 3,000 doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine each day. https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/navigator/"

"@jimgeraghty @Dateline_DC #Schmidlap2024 You know I just don't trust that Johnson and Johnson vaccine or why the Europeans will not take it, said no one ever. No side affects and if goes down nice and smooth, with a Kvass Chaser.Believe in Irving"
Let me do this  Properly! Here is a thread on my Period symptoms post Johnson and Johnson vaccine cause it’s important
This Johnson and Johnson vaccine ain’t no joke 
And it is 28 days for Johnson and Johnson @thegarance. Just administering a shot does not grant immunity (but partial vaccine driven immunity does provide some protection around 10-14 days after the first shot.)
This just in. Shoenice has died from the Johnson and Johnson vaccine
"I got the 1 shot Johnson and Johnson. Idk anything about it being harmful to kids or young women. Not really sure on the info, I just made an appointment and they told me that was the vaccine I would get."
Good luck with that. Synthetic mRNA vaccines have no longterm testing. You're literally injecting novel lipids and synthetic genetic material into your body and nobody knows the long term risks.Go with adenovirus base if u can like Johnson and Johnson.Best of luck though!
Vaccines aren't 100% so say since I got mine but someone around had covid theres still smaller chance I could get it. I had the johnson and johnson one last week and have been doing great. I've also had covid and don't ever want to go through that again.
The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is owned by the pharmaceutical company Janssen. So it’s Johnson and Johnson and Janssen.

Maybe if David can get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine the fight can happen 
"One year after she announced SF’s shelter in place order, Mayor Breed gets her Johnson and Johnson vaccine at Maxine Hall Health Center in the Western Addition"
It’s all political. Europe clearly just don’t want to put their money into a British vaccine. The fact this has happened after they have just approved the johnson and johnson vaccine (made by a Belgian firm) is no coincidence. Please don’t let this put you off getting vaccinated!
Governor Cuomo gets the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today in Harlem. @News12CT #vaccine
Took the Johnson and Johnson vaccination Yesterday it's my arm little sore  but no side effects from vaccine
I asked the local scheduling for covid-19 vaccines if I could choose not to take Johnson and Johnson vaccine for moral reasons.   Apparently they can't tell you before they give it.  They didn't answer concerns about availability of treatment for adverse reactions.
Was able to get my single dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine today thanks to me being a participant in their research study for it. 
"Officials with the state’s COVID-19 command center confirmed an additional 8,000 doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine are making their way to the Bay State this week."
"I'm sure that he is. I don't talk politics with my brothers or sister. He did say that he might get the Johnson and Johnson one later. I told him that I had the Moderna shot Monday, and no issues. I hope that he gets a vaccine."
"Possibly? I was thinking with Johnson and Johnson approval is one reason for the increase.  Also, a pretty 50/50 state politically. I know of a lot of MAGAs not getting it.  There is also a lot of rural areas (mainly MAGA), and harder for everyone there to access vaccine site."
Is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine ?
The WHO’s expert vaccine advisers said Wednesday they could recommend Johnson and Johnson’s COVID-19 jab for use in countries where coronavirus variants of concern are circulating.
Got my Johnson and Johnson vaccine today. “One and Done” no effects so far 
And I know AZ has cut off clause to revert to 'for profit' for rest of world/UK when it chooses. And I know Johnson and Johnson is also at cost. And I know India and SA attempts to suspend IP on vaccines to ramp up production in developing countries has been opposed by UK. #angst
I feel you. I had a 4 hour trip just to get the vaccine (Johnson and Johnson) that I received a week ago
NEW: NY Governor Cuomo has received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He got the shot at the Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem.
doing poppers before getting the johnson and johnson vaccine because i thought it was going to be a DP situation
Ya I guess Johnson and Johnson vaccine is so safe since the company says so(do the research they have paid OVER  4 billion in settlements because they knew BABY powder had cancer causing agents but trust em now) sia fuo
@MattHancock has the Johnson And Johnson covid vaccine been approved for use in the UK?
"congratulations,  I had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine Saturday.  ice your arm for the next 3 day and take Tylenol"
@HandsOnPHX are you guys doing the Johnson and Johnson vaccine at all? I don't want to get that one
Most of Trump’s Warp Speed $ went to Johnson and Johnson.  They made their COVID vaccine from the cells of aborted fetuses!  Where they going to get their cells?
"I am feeling extremely patriotic today even though I am feeling tired and little bit sore.  Thank you Andy, everyone in the Biden administration along with Pfizer,  Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson for making it possible for Americans to receive the vaccine."
That is correct SA is using Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The issue I have is this one:J/J vaccine and AstraZeneca vaccine used the same methodology in vaccine production. They can be scientifically said to be similar.
Looks like just as of today Krogers in Fort Wayne will be getting the one shot (Johnson and Johnson) vaccine starting next Tuesday and has time slots open. I just signed up.
4 different vaccines with different mechanisms some mrna new technology or the Johnson and Johnson is a traditional vaccine at this to Moderna (2nd shot makes people sick).30+ million citizens are a real time vaccination Guinea Pigs.Remember thalidomide?
can you tell hancock bout to end shielding because with this news it is not possible for people who are shielded like myself to go out especially if the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is not available as I am not able to have either of these ones that we have on offer
In Sri Lanka yes. The johnson and Johnson vaccine seems to be good as well.
Nigga asked do we wanna take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine lol might as well pick out your own casket
So anyone thinking about getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine there are some side effects to it that aren't fun but manageable... about 8 hours after I developed a killer headache and body aches with a fever for 2 1/2 days after!
"Can't wait for the new bar arguments, my Pfizer vaccine is better than your Moderna vaccine. F you both Johnson and Johnson rules!"
i told my cousins that are 70 to quit bitchin or get the johnson and johnson vaccine and then they got pfizerd up
Looking for Johnson and Johnson vaccine available for my husband and I.
I heard Johnson and Johnson vaccine is less effective but I’m not sure
"Dr. Rudy talks about the vaccine misinformation out there, how to make good decisions on getting the healthcare you need during the pandemic, and what we can expect from the Johnson and Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines."
"  half of Trump supporters won't even take the vaccine because of person man woman camera TV trust issues. You'd think that would be the other way around. Only in America. Thank you SCIENCE, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and all the scientists that created the vaccine"
I find it funny the way people talk about which vaccine they got: Pfizer GangAstra Zeneca CrewBoth sides don’t respect Team Johnson and Johnson.
"Me a week ago: I dunno, I'm not sure if I'd take the J and J, should I hold out for the Moderna or Pfizer?Vaccine scheduler today: It's the Johnson and Johnson, are you available Saturday?Me today: HELL YES NAME THE TIME AND PLACE AND I'M THERE, LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!!!"
Really want to get Johnson and Johnson vaccine but cannot find a facility who has it...any ideas?
Offically a Johnson and Johnson vaccine gay!
My parents got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. None of my immediately family has been touched by this virus and now I’m concerned because the ppl in charge are so untrustworthy I don’t have confidence in things meant to protect. This sucks
"//Just got my Covid-19 vaccine, the johnson and johnson vaccine"
"I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine yesterday at noon. I felt no symptoms at all up to 8pm. I started feeling unwell, developed a fever, got a headache, and was nauseous. The fever had me up most of the night. Today I woke up w no fever, just a bit of a headache & a bit tired"
"Got my second Pfizer Covid-19 vacation shot today and I didn’t turn into the Incredible Hulk lol it was just like my first Pfizer vaccine and I had no side effects or no soreness in my arm, My wife got the Johnson and Johnson vacation shot the one and done shot"
A third batch of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine landed this weekend.
"Moderna, Pfizer and astra Zeneca are 2 doses. You have to get 2 doses otherwise it's not effective. Johnson and johnson is just one dose.  I think they will have a  vaccine passport.I don't understand why I still need a mask if I'm vaccinated I can't breathe with the damn mask"
"Even the Johnson and Johnson covid vaccine initiative through Quad is suspect, India is already doing a stellar job with vaccine export. The US will come in and claim credit though India would contribute the most scarce commodity now - vaccine mass manufacturing capacity."
Will they be offering Johnson and Johnson vaccine again this weekend?
Why is the governor of Florida saying there are no more Johnson and Johnson Vaccines coming to Florida in the foreseeable future?
Just going over the NY Mets guidelines to attend games at CitiField. You have to produce a negative COVID test or have proof of both shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. They did not acknowledge the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Why yes in fact they do have different rates of efficiency... but it’s only by a little bit. Moderna is 94.5% effective while Pfizer is 95% effective after your second dose and Johnson and Johnson single shot vaccine is least effective at 66%.
Wonderful that Mayor @LondonBreed got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today publicly- so impressed and happy by her vaccine advocacy.
"VACCINE UPDATE: May emergency use listing (EUL) na mula sa World Health Organization (WHO) ang Janssen COVID-19 vaccines at inaasahang mapipirmahan ang supply agreement sa pagitan ng ‘Pinas at Johnson and Johnson ngayong parating na linggo, ayon kay Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr"
Very few side-effects have been reported so far among the more than 177 000 healthcare workers who have received the COVID-19 Johnson and Johnson vaccines. #Vaccine
"The damage has been done. Nobody stopped the Pfizer vaccine and it had comparable ‘yellow card’ issues. And like clockwork the Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson vaccines are now being sold to the EU, 200m doses, as literally announced today. Who profits?"
Here's a thread on the ingredients of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine if it helps you feel better about what exactly is being injected
Nah Johnson and Johnson Vaccine will be manufactured in India for distribution around Asia
Covid vaccines are the biggest experiment in global history:PfizerAstraAzenecaNovavaxSpudnikModernaJohnson and JohnsonPeople want them....Why??
The Johnson and Johnson vaccine looks to be the best of the lot because you only need one Jab not two like the other vaccines to be fully protected
"Why is Canada getting the Astra Zeneca vaccine from the US and not Pfizer or Moderna? I think it’s because the US doesn’t want it as it’s less effective than the others. Why can’t Canada push for more Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines?"
Buffalo need johnson and Johnson vaccines!
Don’t get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine if at all possible. My job gave out that one to all their employees and the side effects were horrid.
"Is it worth mentioning the prospect of more types of vaccine being available?The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is one dose and we have 30m on order, just waiting approval. Maybe under 50s will just have that one through May to July."
@POTUS allegedly our U.K. government has ordered 30 million batches of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I applied to have that vaccine at Gray Hill surgery #Caldicot and they removed me from vaccine list & said under no circumstances could I have J&J that @astrazeneca only choice
"@WhoopiGoldberg the problem with the vaccines is some places are not offering all choices. Nowhere in  Missouri has the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That is the only vaccine I trust and will happily receive, but it's not available."

DEAR FOLLOWERS: If you’re insane enough to get a covid vaccine: My father who is a badass doctor recommends that the Johnson and Johnson one is THE SAFEST.
Does anyone know if rite aid has the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
"Ralph explains the Johnson and Johnson vaccine has left him ""feeling good"" the next day and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, impeded only by the slight technicality that no one knows who is actually eligible for a vaccine and when."
"Companies like Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson. In fact, there's more than 10 vaccines out there and Trump had very little to do with most of them."
"Nice strawman. American companies? No. Lol!!!! Please, name them that have been approved for emergency use. Two are American: Moderna and Johnson and Johnson. Pfizer works with BioNTech.No pharmaceutical company is affiliated with Bill gates. They never came out with a vaccine."
Is the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine good?
"The three vaccines currently authorized for use are Moderna, Pfizer and Janssen (Johnson and Johnson). All are highly effective at preventing severe disease and death from the virus that causes COVID-19."
Direct Deposit: $1400Me at johnson and johnson: I want the Pfizer vaccine
I hope the second dose doesn’t make anyone ill.  I’ve been sick since getting the single dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine on Tuesday.
"30,000 vaccinations administered at FEMA sites in Jacksonville. They’re out of Johnson and Johnson but other vaccines are available. The sites have experienced low turnout and officials encourage people who meet the criteria to get the vaccine. @wjxt4"
"@wsyx6 When you give percentage of people vaccinated, you forget about those who had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. We should be counted too"
@GovPhilScott any news on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine availability? I have ocd and panic disorder. Taking two vaccines is very difficult for me. Cant seem to find any j&j even though I’m qualified to be vaccinated. Thank you!
"Give migrant kids the doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine that American Catholics are refusing to take. Then, put them into foster homes pending adjudication. Problem solved."
"That vaccine swept me off my feet BRUH..but it is totally Worth it Johnson and johnson was only one dose ,so I liked that."
When will the Johnson and Johnson vaccine be approved?30 million doses of that on order should mean under 50s can have just the one jab.
Welp just got my Johnson and Johnson vaccine The liquid from vaccines never fail to hurt me
The relatively few number of problems with the Pfizer/Moderna/Johnson and Johnson vaccines in the clinical studies with a large sample. Those who had the most problems had the placebo.
Yo I qualified for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and am scheduled for Friday  so ready to get this done.
South Georgia Medical Center says it is ready for any increase in patients when the Johnson and Johnson vaccine becomes more readily available to Georgians.
I’m sick to my stomach I thought the Johnson and Johnson vaccine was the one Dolly Parton funded so naturally I booked an appointment to receive THAT ONE. Lo and behold....SHE FUNDED MODERNA. I will be logging off for the rest of the week.
This is encouraging. Some 40 million Americans - about 12% of the U.S. population - have now been fully vaccinated for Covid-19. That means they’ve received either two shots of the Pfizer vaccine or two shots of the Moderna vaccine or one shot of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
"Forest Park campus of St. Louis Community College in West St. Louis. “Mega” COVID-19 vaccination event will take place here for two days next week on March 25th  and 26th. Governor Parson says up to 3,000 doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine will be administered on each day."
"Different COVID-19 Vaccines | CDC drei zugelassen in den USA  Biontech, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna113 Mio Dosen verimpft in USA Trump hat geliefert"
I think it’s time to let people choose to get the johnson and johnson vaccine vs the two MRNA one. I personally think giving people the choice would get more people to volunteer. I know many who don’t want the MRNA but would gladly take the J&J one.
I get my Covid vaccine tomorrow! Johnson and Johnson...so 1 and done!
@UKActionteam are we getting Johnson and Johnson vaccine one shot in the uk does anyone know
"Your mom said she was signed up for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, but it was just a threesome with some dudes"
"I am equally suspicious of all the vaccines, modern, pzifer, Johnson and Johnson, AZ and the others including the Russian vaccine. I have questions about all but since the UK is largely administering AZ this is where my interest lies."
"Y’all, I just got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and idk what to do with myself"
I live over in Cumberland County and my wife (she is a building substitute) was able to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine via the school district last weekend. You'd think though that the process would allow for a doctor to recommend priority.
Good. Let us know when the Johnson and Johnson vaccines are coming to San Antonio please?
"Was worse than that… Trump secured 50 million vaccines.... no backlog at all!!!If he won he didn’t care and if he lost he didn’t care… That’s why he did it. papa Joe came in and ordered 200 million of the Pfizer, 200 million of Moderna, and 200 million of Johnson and Johnson."
"Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine might have become victim of profit mongering BIG pharma like Phizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson!"

Both will keep you out of hospital and from death. Pfizer Messenger stuff is clever. Trouble is temp storage. Best one for simplicity/travel to get the job done is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine : 1 shot and can be stored at standard fridge temp. All of them so clever. 
I had the Johnson and Johnson single dose vaccine on Tuesday.  Within a few hours I felt as bad as I did when I had covid.  I heard that the side effects usuallystop within 48 hrs.  Can’t wait.
Got the Covid vaccine yesterday- the Johnson and Johnson- and feel like trash today. But I’ll take a day of aches and pains if it means protecting others and myself!
@wsyx6 How many people have received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?

If you look at the vaccine website and click on the various places you can see what vaccine. Seem Frys has the most Johnson and Johnson.
I took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today.  It wasn’t bad but I’m glad it’s one and done...for now.
#JohnsonAndJohnson #Vaccine #Vaccination #Catholic #Catholics #COVID19 Catholics can get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine without violating church doctrine.
Johnson and Johnson vaccine requires one dose but harder to get
happy to report that one of the new side effects of the johnson and johnson vaccine i've gotten is a revitalized libido.
Literally just got the Johnson and Johnson out of pure luck. Been trying to get the vaccine in New York and it was super difficult
I’m getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in 24 hoursNation point!!
@GavinNewsom Why isn’t there any Johnson and Johnson one shot for vaccines in the Southbay/Beach areas?
"Fauci was referring to Variants, specifically #P1 that are covered by the new Johnson and Johnson vaccine but not Moderna/Pfizer One more shot =/= Mask forever. https://ucsf.edu/news/2021/03/420071/how-effective-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-heres-what-you-should-know…"
Problem is I think any holiday company would require full vaccination so the 2 jabs. So even giving everybody 1 injection still wouldn't meet the requirements. They need to bring the Johnson and Johnson single jab vaccine into use ASAP to speed things up.
I have a question when will you guys receive shipment of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
Cuomo confirms he is taking the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
"If you are getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, take one or two days off following your shot. This is no joke."
Just got my vaccine! Ended up being the johnson and johnson single shot.
@wsyx6 Include the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in your percentage of people vaccinated.
Justin Trudeau and Doug Fatso Ford should lead by example and stick their arms out for the Pfizer Vaccine... Then their arms out for the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine... Then their arms out for the Moderna Vaccine... Then their arms out for the AstraZeneca Vaccine. #cdnpoli 
"If it has been 90 days since you've had COVID-19, we highly recommend that you get both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine (or the single dose of Johnson and Johnson). You can read more about the vaccine and how it can protect you at http://coronavirus.utah.gov/vaccine."
@AlexBerenson what about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
Im so sorry i haven’t posted anything I’ve been working and then got the johnson and johnson vaccine yesterday and it has knocked me OUT
"What happened to the delivery of all those other vaccines, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson etc. etc?"
"That article is explaning how Johnson and Johnson work, not the other MRNA vaccines. Johnson and Johnsons does need to enter the nucleus, however it cannot alter your DNA, it just finds an enzyme to convert DNA into MRNA for the instructions. MRNA vaccines skip that step"
"When are the Moderna vaccines being delivered to UK? Supposed to be spring, have we got a firmer date or even Month yet? Also is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine likey to be approved soon?"
The site officials said currently Pfizer. “At this time the state has not received additional doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.”
I did! I’m aiming towards the Johnson and Johnson but the results j&j have aren’t the same as moderna and Pfizer because it hasn’t been out that long. Results for j&j like the other two vaccines won’t be out until May! Only thing holding me back lol..
"Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson showed they provided protection against different strains, like the U.K. variant. Dr. Nistico says the AstraZeneca vaccine likely won't be approved if it won't provide protection against what health officials anticipate will be the dominant"
Moderna vaccines come in post easter. I wonder if they ordered the one shot Johnson and Johnson one
"My husband and I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine on Friday, and we both had minimal side effects. I’m so happy for you!"
"Leaky vaccine= mareks disease for humans. Bow down to the new overlords Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson. Take the vaccine or die!"
Under no circumstance am I getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
"Canada must not fund doctors who want to fly to SA and Brazil for racist Covid-19 research, that will lead to race vaccines like Johnson and Johnson. They must find variants in Canada's backyard. Africa and China hv been blamed for Europe's plagues since the 14th century."
Johnson and Johnson vaccine will be used only on black people. The whole of Africa and Brazil shud reject this vaccine because it is 'effective in countries where coronavirus variants are spreading.'
Give them the old fashioned Johnson and Johnson vaccine without the RNA thingy in it.
"With the Pfizer, Moderna and now Johnson and Johnson vaccines available, one health department is making it their goal to get rural Nebraskan's vaccinated.@StumChrisTV has the story"
they probably mean like different brands of it because there’s one’s like the johnson and johnson vaccine
"Exactly. During the summer, when Johnson and Johnson said they were making a vaccine. I said “I’m not taking a vaccine from someone who is currently paying billions in lawsuits for baby powder causing cancer...” If they can’t get baby powder right....I’m not trusting them."
@billcarrolltalk You can Take the astrazeneca vaccine but I won't be or the Johnson and Johnson. At 62 and 72 percent Dollarama vaccines. Ban them . Phizer only or Moderna for this Guy. I'll walk away if anything else is offered until I get what I want.
