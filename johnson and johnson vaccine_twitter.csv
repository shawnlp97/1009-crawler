"I shouldn't have to say this, but ... If you are able, get vaccinated. If your concerned about mRNA (something we've had for over a decade), get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine."
Vaccine supplies definitely causing issues for us here. I'm hoping the Johnson and Johnson one will be approved soon and we can start using that too.
"Should you get a Johnson and Johnson vaccine, or wait for Pfizer or Moderna? Doctor weighs in  https://bit.ly/3eXnNi3 #abc15"

"Or I check the AZ offer to deliver 100 mil vaccines in Q1 and then see that in reality they'll only deliver 30 mil and think glad we also ordered Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines. Then I'd check the UK export numbers and think that's certainly not the way to go"
"I DO NOT WANT the Astra-Zeneca vaccine....I do not feel it is safe. It is so nice the USA is offering to send us vaccines, ty but why only Astra-Zeneca!!! I would be more happy to see Pfizer or Moderna or Johnson and Johnson."

"Got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine yesterday. I feel like absolute dog shit today, but this is better than getting covid so "
