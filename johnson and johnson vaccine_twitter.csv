More from this morning's briefing...Dr. Earl Stoddard of @ReadyMontgomery says he's under the impression that the state will prioritize the Johnson and Johnson one-dose vaccines for mass vaccination sites. @WDVMTV
I just want a Johnson and Johnson vaccine so I don’t have to go in twice... but apparently that’s not likely to happen...
"I'm a week and a day out from getting Johnson and Johnson vaccine.  I had ZERO side effects. In 6 more days I will be 2 weeks out and then I'll feel safer than I have in a year of hermit living.  I'm so grateful for hope.  I'll still wear mask but I'm not as ""terrorized"" now."

Register now! Johnson and Johnson vaccines are available this Saturday with our partners at Elm Grove Baptist Church in Baton Rouge! #getoutthevaccine
Went to the VA outpatient clinic and got the Johnson and Johnson single shot covid-19 vaccine  ( NO PROBLEMS NO REACTION )
"Get vaccinated, but not with Johnson and Johnson. Breaking news is that it's good for countries where variants are spreading. SA and Brazil are accused of stronger variants. Black people with end up being given special vaccines like J&J."
"I am equally suspicious of all the vaccines, modern, pzifer, Johnson and Johnson, AZ and the others including the Russian vaccine. I have questions about all but since the UK is largely administering AZ this is where my interest lies."
"The EU has exported 44 million vaccine doses to 33 countries, but the US which is receding EU vaccines have blocked exports in the other direction. This is a preemptive tussle about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as much as anything"
Cheapest one seems to be Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
i want to k word my mom she got a call that she can go get the moderna vaccine but she won’t get it bc she wants the johnson and johnson one based on no medical or scientific reasoning just that “it feels like the right choice” like bro what the fuck
doing poppers before getting the johnson and johnson vaccine because i thought it was going to be a DP situation
They need the Johnson and Johnson vaccine!!
Most of Trump’s Warp Speed $ went to Johnson and Johnson.  They made their COVID vaccine from the cells of aborted fetuses!  Where they going to get their cells?
That is correct SA is using Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The issue I have is this one:J/J vaccine and AstraZeneca vaccine used the same methodology in vaccine production. They can be scientifically said to be similar.
"Dude, can you hook me up with some of that Johnson and Johnson vaccine? I'll take care of you promise."
"Not this time. 3 covid vaccines were actually developed in Europe. Germany financed BioNTech (Pfizer) R&D, Johnson and Johnson was developed by Janssen in Belgium and AstraZeneca by Oxford university."
Omg I will really appreciate it. The thing is they need Johnson and Johnson because of allergies. I would really appreciate it
"The may also be an issues with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine I suspect, becuase Phizer and BioNtech are due to make $13 billion from and vaccine whereas AZ and J&J are pledges to make no profits from their vaccines. Just watch......"
#PoliticsLive Iain Dale is misleading or ill informed - Johnson and Johnson vaccine - which EU has authorised and has advance purchase of 200 million doses - is not for profit.
So I got the Johnson and Johnson covid vaccine yesterday and uhShit sucks
Is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine any good?
What’s wrong with Zimbabwe?  Also the Sinopharm vaccine has a better efficacy than Astra Zeneca and Johnson and Johnson.

HAWAII just cancelled all our appointments for the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine thru 4/3 and they say the WHOLE STATE IS NOT GETTING ANY... IS THIS A LIE???
"The Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vacccines have been given to over 900people who’ve since died, including 16 people in Switzerland.  It is said the deaths are nothing to do with the vaccine.  Why doesn’t the EU ban these vaccines or is it just anti U.K. politics."
Got my  Johnson and Johnson vaccine today arm hurt for three minutes I feel like I have energy and I don’t know if this is from the shot or just feel good about getting it!

This is one I won't take. So far I haven't taken a vaccine. I don't take a flu shot either. I take no medicine other then atibiotics for illness sometimes. So I will wait and see. This is all experimental at this point. If i decide to take anything it will be Johnson and Johnson.
does anyone know where i can get a johnson and johnson vaccine in nola/br?
Rodrigo Izquierdo asks what would happen if someone got a first dose of one vaccine and then a second dose of another vaccine. He also asks if the homeless should be vaccinated with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
Called to confirm. West side Walgreens is doing open walk ups Johnson and Johnson vaccines today. They had 150 extra and they expire Saturday. Get there west side !  I’m pretty sure this is the one dose vaccine ! Pass along
"So I got Johnson and Johnson, and their vaccine uses common cold cells to hide the RNA that makes Covid spikes so deadly and foreign to our bodies inside them and carry them in, like the Battle if Troy with the wooden horse.... so it’s just an immune response."

"Miracles are possible *and* science is incredible. I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today along with my parents thanks to kind staff who insisted we all get them as a family. I hope everyone can get their vaccine (Pfizer/Moderna/J&J) as soon as possible, they *all* work. "

"#AstraZeneca why is it so that no other vaccine, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna hve not come up with the same kind or othe side effects?"
Was able to get my single dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine today thanks to me being a participant in their research study for it. 
I still didn't get my stimulus money. And when is Johnson and Johnson  distributing vaccine?
"Canada must not fund doctors who want to fly to SA and Brazil for racist Covid-19 research, that will lead to race vaccines like Johnson and Johnson. They must find variants in Canada's backyard. Africa and China hv been blamed for Europe's plagues since the 14th century."
Johnson and Johnson. i spoke too late. it's a vaccine that will be used mainly on black people bc of so-called variants found in SA n Brazil.
"Nice strawman. American companies? No. Lol!!!! Please, name them that have been approved for emergency use. Two are American: Moderna and Johnson and Johnson. Pfizer works with BioNTech.No pharmaceutical company is affiliated with Bill gates. They never came out with a vaccine."

Any Johnson and Johnson vaccines anywhere?
I was fortunate to receive the one - shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine at my family doc's office a week ago.  I didn't hesitate for a moment to say yes to an appointment when they called.
Usually agree with you but not on this one. French are notoriously bad at vaccinations. Any hint of problems plus the production problems (AZ now producing even less than they said the second time) cause jitters. The Johnson and Johnson and Russian vaccines are being looked at.
My uncle took the vaccine yesterday he said prior to getting there he was told he would get the Pfizer or Moderna but when he got there they only had Johnson and Johnson.
"Got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine today, will post updates tomorrow on side effects and what not"
"johnson and johnson said ""we've been handling the band-aid side of vaccines for years, we can handle the other part too."""
I would contemplate the Johnson and johnson as it is more of a traditional vaccine. Not the others though
"Ralph explains the Johnson and Johnson vaccine has left him ""feeling good"" the next day and encourages everyone to get vaccinated, impeded only by the slight technicality that no one knows who is actually eligible for a vaccine and when."

"Got the Johnson and Johnson #COVID19 vaccine  yesterday. With J&J you only need 1 dose! With Pfizer and Moderna you'll need 2 doses but ALL 3 are safe and effective so get whatever vaccine is available! Side effects? Yes. Headache, fatigue, soreness, 1or 2 days It's working! "

Neither .Waiting for Johnson and Johnson 's vaccine.
Experiencing worst symptoms than Covid after the Johnson and Johnson vaccine shot
Absolutely not you. You never hear of any other vax being knocked. Remember Johnson and Johnson & others have yet to be approved! It harms vaccine confidence and exta deaths through covid because of it.

I got the Johnson and Johnson one because it’s only one dose!.... and it’s the only vaccine that was studied with the new mutations/variants
I feel you. I had a 4 hour trip just to get the vaccine (Johnson and Johnson) that I received a week ago
Governor Newsom:  We are going from scarcity in the next 5 or 6 weeks to abundance. #Ktvu Says we will be in a significant different place in 6 or so weeks.  Says expecting Johnson and Johnson vaccine supply to improve exponentially.

"HOLLYWOOD, SC Johnson and Johnson vaccines available today with no appointment"
Anyone know of any open appts for Johnson and Johnson vaccine only in search........ I was able to put myself on one list for cvs but doubtful I will get called.
The Johnson and Johnson vaccine does not.

It’s Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine deal with that
Has anyone taken the johnson and Johnson vaccine? Or know something who has?
"you’re welcome! it also depends on which company you’re getting your vaccine from. one takes 21 days, another takes 28 days and the most recent one (johnson and johnson) consists of only one shot"
Merkel and the EU is finished.They are a complete farce . we can't rely on them for vaccines.They are a corrupt bunch of fraudsters .Its time THE IRISH GOVERNMENT GOT VACCINES FROM JOHNSON AND JOHNSON AND PFIZER FOR OUR OWN USE.THIS IS BEEN DRAGGED ON FAR TOO LONG.
"Your mom said she was signed up for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, but it was just a threesome with some dudes"
"Get vaccinated, but not with Johnson and Johnson, a vaccine for black people. Before getting vaccinated, ask which vaccine your clinic is using. We were told it's one virus. Why make a vaccine that for countries with variants?"
"Thank you. I guess their decision is understandable, given they now have several different variants to deal with. I note the Johnson and Johnson vaccine only has 57% efficacy against the South African variant."
Do you know where can I get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? I'm traveling and won't be able to get the second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine
Just talked to the first person I’ve heard to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. So happy to hear stories of people getting vaccinated! #BTHOCovid
And there it is! One and done! Doing my part to keep those around me safe. Johnson and Johnson vaccine is complete.

Offically a Johnson and Johnson vaccine gay!
I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and all I had was a sore arm. I know it's anecdotal but that's my experience
"Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson are currently the only authorized vaccines from the CDC."
The other thing to consider is whether you want to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. It is not an mRNA type vaccine but was developed using traditional techniques used in the development of a number of other long-standing vaccines. It also only requires a single dose 
Is there any sign of the Moderna or Johnson and johnson vaccines? I think they are already being used in USA. Feel very sorry for so many of the 20 and 30 somethings. First to lose their jobs last to get their jabs
happy to report that one of the new side effects of the johnson and johnson vaccine i've gotten is a revitalized libido.

"vaccine appts at Publix went by fast this morning because those are Johnson and Johnson on Wednesdays. There’s way fewer of those doses than the 2 dose brands. Everyone’s having different challenges with this thing, but to say what we’re reporting isn’t true, just isn’t accurate"
"and Pfizer vaccine, that ingredient is causing allergic reactions, (rarely) but just to throw that out there as a positive to the Johnson and Johnson!"
"If 1. They could tell me epi pens were on standby in case of anaphylaxis since mine is expired and 2. They could let me choose to NOT get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine which was developed using aborted fetal cells, I'd be far less resistant to taking it."
Under no circumstance am I getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
people need Johnson and Johnson diapers first before reading your thread about the vaccine
Why are the BBC obsessed with independent foreign medical regulators taking a different view to our own. Why don’t they ask why the UK  regulator hasn’t approved the Johnson and Johnson vaccine when the USA has.Or have they got a European agenda ?
That Johnson and Johnson vaccine really kicking my ass right now
"Companies like Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson. In fact, there's more than 10 vaccines out there and Trump had very little to do with most of them."

"Thinking about getting the vaccine, maybe the Johnson and Johnson one."
My parents got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. None of my immediately family has been touched by this virus and now I’m concerned because the ppl in charge are so untrustworthy I don’t have confidence in things meant to protect. This sucks
"I'm sure that he is. I don't talk politics with my brothers or sister. He did say that he might get the Johnson and Johnson one later. I told him that I had the Moderna shot Monday, and no issues. I hope that he gets a vaccine."

Has anyone received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?  Looking for pros and cons with this particular one
I personally am leaning towards the Johnson and Johnson vector viral vaccine. So far seems the safest. 
The one dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine will make it easier to reach that goal.
Soooo what there saying is I should hold out for Johnson and Johnson?Cause I mean at some point we will have more vaccine than arms needing it and I will get that choice
A lot of people want the Johnson and Johnson vaccine
@USAinUK I’m being denied access to Johnson and Johnson vaccine here in the U.K. - they say only option @Astrazeneca - is it possible to arrange to visit US embassy in either London or #Wales if there is an office in order to have what I believe as the most scientific solution?
Everyone is entitled to their opinion about the vaccine. I’m not getting it either unless I have no choice.. then it will only be the Johnson and Johnson Poison lol
"Johnson and Johnson. Do you know which vaccine is being injected in your arm? Johnson and Johnson vaccine is supposedly good for countries with variants, and they are in Africa and Brazil. Reject it."
how belgian colonialism led to the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine
"Exactly. During the summer, when Johnson and Johnson said they were making a vaccine. I said “I’m not taking a vaccine from someone who is currently paying billions in lawsuits for baby powder causing cancer...” If they can’t get baby powder right....I’m not trusting them."
Received my Johnson and Johnson vaccine yesterday. Today I have a ton of side effects but one day of side effects is better than covid
"Possibly? I was thinking with Johnson and Johnson approval is one reason for the increase.  Also, a pretty 50/50 state politically. I know of a lot of MAGAs not getting it.  There is also a lot of rural areas (mainly MAGA), and harder for everyone there to access vaccine site."
"BREAKING: Governor Hogan just clarified for @wbaltv11 details on vaccine supply per WH call: Biden Amin says NO shipments of Johnson and Johnson coming to states this week OR next week, as WH said previously"
I received a Johnson and Johnson vaccine today at my daughters adult day facility! I am very grateful today.

"nothing but gratitude to learn that my dad and stepmom have received their vaccines. They were both a part of the Johnson and Johnson study, and were in the control group. Since J&J was approved, they went back to get real shots."

"@KMhlokozi you are a directionless http://president.You have given your friends from Johnson and Johnson and as well as Aspen the rights to distribute the COVID-19 vaccines because they donated million of Rands to the CR17 CAMPAIGN,and you come here with useless poems."
I still don’t understand how y’all want me to take a vaccine made by Johnson and Johnson when baby powder was killing us this whole time. Like do you think ima give these mother fuckers the chance?
i just know the chip in the johnson and johnson vaccine a crab chip. (maryland) do it right.
USA will bail Canada out! Johnson and Johnson vaccines and some Doritos.
"i don’t think so! in case you’re curious, indiana gets 175,500 Pfizer vaccines and 128,200 moderna vaccines each week (evenly divided between first and second doses) so in theory 151,850 people should get their first shot each week + 7,500 Johnson and Johnson shots"
"Received first vaccine shot. Pfizer, at a drive through. I am scared of needles, so hoped for the Johnson and Johnson. I was waiting for it to hurt, told the volunteer Fire Chief to go ahead after he swabbed the area, he said, “It’s done”.Huh?Still no reaction after 5 days."
So Johnson and Johnson vaccines use genetic material from the actual COVID-19 virus but places it in another virus... #dgl #lod #jadita
"Moderna, Pfizer and astra Zeneca are 2 doses. You have to get 2 doses otherwise it's not effective. Johnson and johnson is just one dose.  I think they will have a  vaccine passport.I don't understand why I still need a mask if I'm vaccinated I can't breathe with the damn mask"
I just got a call to get a Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine...and I didn't even know wtf to say cuz I haven't even researched any of this bullshit. I told them to give it to someone else who needs it cuz I dunno

"I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine and my only side effect has really being fatigue other than that I feel alright , but I definitely been taking my vitamins & seamoss"
Government is unnecessarily hoarding the jab. And  approval process is not fair to all.why they have restricted sputnik v from approval.New vaccines from Johnson and Johnson and novavox  are very effective.But mark my word they will not approve them before July.

Y’all I might have a chance to get the vaccine... but it’s the Johnson and Johnson.
Johnson and Johnson poisoned babies with asbestos and then lied about it.Whatever assurance that company provides for its vaccine won't be enough.
Johnson and Johnson vaccine will be used only on black people. The whole of Africa and Brazil shud reject this vaccine because it is 'effective in countries where coronavirus variants are spreading.'
"Dr. Rudy talks about the vaccine misinformation out there, how to make good decisions on getting the healthcare you need during the pandemic, and what we can expect from the Johnson and Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines."
Nah Johnson and Johnson Vaccine will be manufactured in India for distribution around Asia
"And that’s on a matter of opinion. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is a different makeup than the moderna and Pfizer. Just like the flu shot and tdap in the 3rd trimester, the benefits outweigh the risks IMO."
Has anyone gotten the Johnson and Johnson vaccine?
Johnson and Johnson vaccine only if you are forced
AZ is similar to Johnson and Johnson's vaccine. Both are vector vaccines.
What about the Moderna and Johnson and Johnson Vaccines?
"Gov. Tim Walz has not yet been vaccinated yet. Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan has received one of two required Moderna doses, while Commissioner Jan Malcolm has received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine ""but is still within the 14 day waiting period,"" according to the release."
And it’s official. Johnson and Johnson vaccine and a stare down with the photographer

"If a Catholic refuses the Johnson and Johnson vaccine based on their beliefs, what are they gonna do if they get Covid and the Doctor treating them is in a same sex marriage?"
What happened to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine? @CPHO_Canada @JustinTrudeau @BogochIsaac @celliottability
"I think that the AZ vaccine is manufactured across 3 sites in the UK...Im not sure that Pfizer, being a US headquartered company would appreciate not only having their production facilities expropriated, but also their intellectual property....Same goes for Johnson and Johnson."
"Are there conclusive studies already regarding which vaccines are effective in addressing new variants, or is more data needed? there are reports claiming the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is one of those that is effective against the new variants of the virus."

my work is administering the Johnson and Johnson vaccine here on site but I can’t get it 
Covid vaccines are the biggest experiment in global history:PfizerAstraAzenecaNovavaxSpudnikModernaJohnson and JohnsonThey might not even work. People get a card with number on and a Crown logo on. Not for me.
Keep up the good job tho. See your trying. Let us know when the next presser. I'm not in media but I'd love to know if we adjusting the amount of Johnson and Johnson and Moderna Vaccines we purchasing. When those batches slated to come?
"The damage has been done. Nobody stopped the Pfizer vaccine and it had comparable ‘yellow card’ issues. And like clockwork the Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson vaccines are now being sold to the EU, 200m doses, as literally announced today. Who profits?"
"Can't wait for the new bar arguments, my Pfizer vaccine is better than your Moderna vaccine. F you both Johnson and Johnson rules!"
Justin Trudeau and Doug Fatso Ford should lead by example and stick their arms out for the Pfizer Vaccine... Then their arms out for the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine... Then their arms out for the Moderna Vaccine... Then their arms out for the AstraZeneca Vaccine. #cdnpoli

"With the large caveat that there are reporting lags with getting the Johnson and Johnson doses reported, this map shows the percentage of delivered J&J doses that have been administered. The data are quite variable, with some states quicker to roll out the vaccine than others."
@bracketdan I got my covid vaccine at the Esports stadium! Smooth process! But I got the Johnson and Johnson!!! One and done!
Johnson and Johnson vaccine only 66% effective. Moderna me please
Fucking Johnson and Johnson baby powder causes cancer and people taking their vaccines? And the vaccine isn’t even 100% effective 
i think it depends on pfizer or moderna (or johnson and johnson) i got Moderna and had no reaction to both vaccines but it’s because i usually don’t reacteveryone’s different though
Glenwood South Pharmacy  Market is one of the small retail pharmacies in the county that’s received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
Vaccines aren't 100% so say since I got mine but someone around had covid theres still smaller chance I could get it. I had the johnson and johnson one last week and have been doing great. I've also had covid and don't ever want to go through that again.
"USA and I fully support Pfizer, moderna and Johnson and Johnson’s vaccine. I don’t know about vaccines outside of the U.S. to have an opinion."

I am driving four hours this morning to Quincy Illinois so I can get my Johnson and Johnson vaccine
i was in the middle of signing up to get the vaccine but my mom wants to wait for the johnson and johnson one since it’s only one dose
Yeah. I wasn't too keen on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That 72%-93%~ effectiveness is just too much variance for my liking.
Completely untrue. The states were bitching their heads off under trump. Trump dumped it all on the states just like he did with covid with no federal support. Way differentThis isn’t true. He used the defense production act to get more Johnson and Johnson vaccines. Lol.
"Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson. What do these companies have in common? They developed the first 3 vaccines. What else do they have in common? They are American companies. America has vaccine more individuals than any other nation worldwide, and its not really close."
Johnson and Johnson doesn’t require the refrigeration it takes to get the vaccine to rural areas who don’t have the capacity
I laugh every time I hear 1 shot johnson (and Johnson vaccine)

"They need to manufacture more, we're in mass  but local shelters have been told the issue is waiting for more to be made in general. the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, at least"
Hey bro. Look closely at the types of vaccines.  Google Eua advisory packet “Pfizer” “Moderna” and “Johnson and Johnson”. Make an informed decision. Look at adverse reactions profiles. Grade 3 affects etc. all three provide protection but all three have dif reactions. 
Where is the johnson and johnson vaccine here in Florida???My Grandma wants it... I can't find it.Where is it...
@POTUS allegedly our U.K. government has ordered 30 million batches of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I applied to have that vaccine at Gray Hill surgery #Caldicot and they removed me from vaccine list & said under no circumstances could I have J&J that @astrazeneca only choice
"That is very true. I definitely think Johnson and Johnson has a lot of good to offer, and obviously far better than no vaccine at all. For me, even getting mildly sick is enough to freak me out. :s"
Majority of those who have been vaccinated say they have had no adverse reactions after getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. https://ayr.app/l/vjEq

Just got a leftover dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine at a Duane Reade. I literally meandered in and asked and they said yes and gave it to me. Cannot recommend this strategy more highly
"The Liverpool vaccine, the one and done. Ooops it's Johnson and Johnson."
"Apparently, some confusion as to whether Johnson chose the vaccine, but it depends on which centre he is going to. MORE IMPORTANTLY, if he had waited we could have had the headline 'Johnson Jabbed with Johnson and Johnson Jab by Nurse Johnson' (I'm sure we could find one)."
When will the Johnson and Johnson vaccine be approved?30 million doses of that on order should mean under 50s can have just the one jab.

"Yep big supply problems, we should be on past May as moderna, Johnson and Johnson and Novavax vaccine should come online by then"
I did! I’m aiming towards the Johnson and Johnson but the results j&j have aren’t the same as moderna and Pfizer because it hasn’t been out that long. Results for j&j like the other two vaccines won’t be out until May! Only thing holding me back lol..
"Also, don’t we have a number  of different vaccines coming in line eg Johnson and Johnson?"
Have my one and done Johnson and Johnson vaccine already.

"Who developed Warp Speed? Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Astrozeneca. Warp Speed occurred because these companies set aside profit and privacy, shared research and data with each other to get the vaccine out faster. Trump takes credit, but deserves very little."

"With the Pfizer, Moderna and now Johnson and Johnson vaccines available, one health department is making it its goal to get rural Nebraskan's vaccinated @StumChrisTV reports"
Buffalo need johnson and Johnson vaccines!
Good luck with that. Synthetic mRNA vaccines have no longterm testing. You're literally injecting novel lipids and synthetic genetic material into your body and nobody knows the long term risks.Go with adenovirus base if u can like Johnson and Johnson.Best of luck though!
We’d save so much time if the Johnson and Johnson vaccine is in wide distribution
Yo I qualified for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and am scheduled for Friday  so ready to get this done.
Am I basing what vaccine I get around one tik tok I saw of someone feeling nauseous after the Johnson and Johnson? Yes.

"When are the Moderna vaccines being delivered to UK? Supposed to be spring, have we got a firmer date or even Month yet? Also is the Johnson and Johnson vaccine likey to be approved soon?"
Getting my first vaccine shot tomorrow. Happy to have found an appointment. Tbh I wish I could get my hands on that Johnson and Johnson so I can get one shot and be done with it but whatever’s available shall do!
Also some people would prefer the Johnson and Johnson Vaccine over the AstraZeneca esp given the concerns countries have with that particular vaccine

@OrangeCoFL went to Valencia college this morning to get Johnson And Johnson vaccine and was told they only had Pfizer. Is there any way to tell when they have the Johnson and Johnson vaccines available? Or should we just go every morning to see?
Give them the old fashioned Johnson and Johnson vaccine without the RNA thingy in it.
Why are we not looking at getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine here? We need more choices. Pfizer is practically not available here and If the AZ is pulled we’re rooted?
I asked the local scheduling for covid-19 vaccines if I could choose not to take Johnson and Johnson vaccine for moral reasons.   Apparently they can't tell you before they give it.  They didn't answer concerns about availability of treatment for adverse reactions.
Got the Johnson and Johnson #covid19 shot.  Heart was racing all night. Worst headache and I still have it. Aches and pains and low fever.   Got vaccine at 1p pain started by 10p and still in pain next day at 5p

Johnson and Johnson vaccine will be a game changer. One shot 
No one. I also noticed that no one picked up on Johnson and Johnson losing hundreds of millions because of the Talc powder lawsuit only to make it back with covid-19 vaccines
Entlek how many vaccine doses did SA receive? Isn't it 160k doses of Johnson and Johnson doses so far? And you already vaccinated 168k health workers?
Vaccine Day! I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine at Kaiser Vallejo. Seamless process and very quick. Yay me!
"The politics are about the countries of origin for the vaccines. No one will question the safety of any of the American vaccines. Pfeizer, Moderna or Johnson and Johnson... The market for AZ is being destroyed."
Hard pass if it's the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I'd rather gamble on COVID than inject whatever pisswater and asbestos is in that syringe.
Got my vaccine today and apparently I don’t have to go back because the Johnson and Johnson shot that I got is a one dose vaccine. How awesome is that??!!!#COVID19Vaccine #johnsonandjohnson #COVIDVaccination #COVID19 #WritersLife
Oh and Johnson and Johnson is an American company so I truly cannot figure out your argument...without the big bad American producers nobody would would any vaccines
