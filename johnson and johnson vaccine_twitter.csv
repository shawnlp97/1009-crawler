I just realized what covid vaccine you first get will be something that people talk about and are categorized by for the rest of their life. Like some people will be on team Moderna others team Pfizer and so on. If you’re lucky enough team Johnson and Johnson and their one shot.

Context matters. Johnson and johnson is also the the only vaccine tested against the new strains.
This chick said earlier that she feels better about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and got it because it’s only one shot and lmfaooooo I swear y’all’s logic is just dumb as hell sometimes

Hi! Here’s my 24 hour Johnson and Johnson Vaccine diary! Honestly I had a pretty easy expierence and I’m thankful! Thanks @sarahbearah for the inspiration!
"“The Scientific Agency in our country is working on collaboration with Schykille on a Covid 19 vaccine. Me and Karkanov do not trust the Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Pfitzer, not even the Sputnik vaccine. Also who’s idea to test them on children? Unacceptable!”. On COVID"
US has not approved the AZ vaccine for use. Single dose Johnson and Johnson was the one they were looking to share. It’s currently in use in the states.
Got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine! Not my first choice but hey I’ll take it
"For anyone getting shots, the first distribution is like 2 shots. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine however, is just one. So far, I'm just experiencing soreness from the shot and feeling a bit sluggish. But don't worry, things are going good. I should've used my right arm instead."
I think getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine  is the first step for me in order to lose my virginity now I just need a girlfriend
"Don’t forget to stop by Sunday night at 8:30 PM EST for my latest COMICAL WEEK IN REVIEW (link will be provided). Like the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, it’s available in one shot. #comicalweekinreview"
I got my Johnson and Johnson single shot Covid 19 vaccine today. Two weeks from now I should be pretty safe.
"Nevermind. I know what you're talking about now. I'm scheduled for April 3 and it's the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is only one they said."
yes the Johnson and Johnson have lower rates at preventing the virus from infecting someone. they prevent the need for hospitalization and their rates go up astronomically when there is a herd immunity when enough people have the vaccines.
"Went to the beauty supply for ONE thing, a brush. $60 later.... smh. However, came to Duane Reade for one thing as well, toilet paper, 15 mins later I've hit the covid vaccine. And it was the Johnson and Johnson so I'm done with 1 shot."
"“The ‘best’ vaccine? Don’t be misled in comparing efficacy of Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer/BioNTech. The best vaccine for you is the one that is offered to you.”"
didnt know the Johnson and Johnson one is more like an old school vaccine (like Astrazeneca is). Good to know in case vaccines become mandatory!
"Yes, Harry, I got muh Johnson and Johnson vaccine, and am currently reading ""Blood and Iron."" It don't get much better than this!"
Please dont visit mom and dad or god forbid grandma and grandpa. They need to test them before they go back to dorms. And than give them the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because thy won’t stop and they wont come for second one.
One vaccine? Johnson and Johnson?
My friends 32 year old son with zero underlying pre conditions died less than 24 hours after his injection with the Johnson and Johnson vaccine!
