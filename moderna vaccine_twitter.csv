You're wrong about that. The ut of anything pence deserves partial credit. He started warp speed which only helped the moderna vaccine while Pfizer did it all on it's own. Also trump never did anything he gave the job of handling the pandemic to pence so give pence gets credit
this moderna vaccine is kicking my ass....and the second shot supposed to be worse 
Actually trump had nothing to do with that. First he out pence in charge covid operations not himself. Second whether he funded moderna or not Pfizer wouldve came out with a vaccine as it never got government funding. Third Pence deserves the credit not trump. Biden amplified it.

"Pfizer and Moderna: MRNA but no aborted baby cell lines used in production, only during initial development. Johnson & Johnson: traditional vaccine, not MRNA, but was developed and produced with aborted baby cell lines."
"It ""probably cost lives"" when AstraZeneca paused their own trial to investigate a safety issue, delaying results. This is making too big a deal out of something that's normal and expected. Moderna's vaccine was paused in California over concerns about a batch, etc."
My husband had the Moderna vaccine and had absolutely no side effects at all with either shot. I received the Pfizer and I didn’t either.
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not highly effective against some of the newer variants (but they ARE better than having no vaccine). Novel coronavirus will keep mutating as long as it’s allowed to replicate by the USgov. It also comes with high morbidity rates.

Getting the Moderna vaccine. I left quite a few ppl go before me & I still feel guilty about getting it. So many ppl still waiting. I think that 25 ppl had blood clots from that one out of 20 million ppl. I would ask your doctor just because of your kidneys just to be safe.

Our options aren’t AZ or nothing so it’s a false comparison. They are AZ or Pfizer/Moderna/JJ/Novavax. It’s the govt’s negligence/incompetence in vaccine procurement that’s resulted in this situation.
"All the approved vaccines in the US make spike proteins using mRNA. The Pfizer and Moderna use actual mRNA, while the J&J uses another virus to infect a cell’s nucleus with DNA from which mRNA is transcribed. The end result is the same."

It seems like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have better outcomes in terms of side-effects. Is Norway prioritizing giving out more if these instead of AstraZeneca?
"Already took the Moderna vaccine, I felt like I had won the lottery! No negative side effects just a little soreness in my arm."

What happened?
"Under the tripartite agreement, the Philippine government secured 13 million doses of Moderna vaccines, while the private sector — led by business tycoon Enrique Razon — ordered 7 million vaccine doses for its frontline workers."
You’re doing the work of the ruling-class by establishing a caste system: Vaccinated? You can re-enter society. Not? You can’t. Pfizer/Moderna aren’t “vaccines”; they’re gene-therapy drugs. None are licensed; all are considered “experimental”. Go read the Nuremberg Code.
The Philippines has secured 20 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine in a tripartite deal with the United States biotech company and the private sector.

How does it feel to know that you had a vaccine for a pandemic that people are dying from right now and all you had to do was give them the research that you had to save their lives but instead you let them die how do you sleep at night?

I received the Moderna first dose vaccine. Michael Caine was right—it didn’t hurt. Only side effect is my hair seems fluffier.
