Why are you on the fence? The vaccine protects against serious illness and death in most cases. Both my husband and I have had both doses. He’s Pfizer and I’m Moderna. Millions have received the vaccine. Join us!
I felt I'd enjoy the Snyder cut more if I chugged a bottle of Robitussin. I got the Moderna vaccine & feeling extremely strung out. Here we go!
Got my first jab of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine just now. Guess that makes me post-moderna.

got my first vaccine today at the LA County USC site  #moderna
"And a genius on tech stuff just got me an appointment for vaccine, blocks from my house and Pfizer, which has fewer reactions than Moderna! So I'll be healthy to travel!"
"Thank you for addressing this, I am interested in the AZ or JnJ vaccines over the Pfizer and Moderna, but it’s hard to find reliable sources that drill down into it."
"dear future lawyer looking for plaintiffs for a class action lawsuit: on mar. 18 2021 at 2:43pm I received the first moderna vaccine, and on mar. 19 at ~11am i began menstruation a week and a half early. i'm probably infertile now. i'm entitled to compensation.  love, paige"
Just received my second dose COVID vaccine. Thanks @moderna_tx  and front line workers!  #science
"Mind you the directive to delay AZ came a few days after I got my shot, so I was unsure if they will keep it. Plus they deliver less vaccines these days, both AZ and the pushed russian and chinese vaccines, while not really getting any of Moderna."
"The drug company Moderna has begun a study that will test its COVID vaccine in children younger than 12, including babies as young as 6 months. From the New York Times: https://bit.ly/2P3xBw1"
"Mukhang ok naman yung vaccine na sinovac  ,di naman naging zombie papa ko  So ano na self , sino susundin mo  Si papa na sinovac oh si mother na MODERNA gusto"
"So far, @AusPublicHealth has only received the 2-dose Moderna vaccine, but Director Stephanie Hayden-Howard is hopeful the 1-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is on the way to APH, speeding up distribution. They've requested 12,000 doses— @MeaEscott says they'll likely come in April"
Now that I’ve gotten the Pfizer vaccine can I start discriminating against people who have gotten the Moderna one?
Get it! Any version. I’ve had both doses of the Moderna vaccine. I feel a good deal of protection
6 days since shot #2 went in the arm. Almost there... #immunity #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #modernavaccine
"We'll see if either of us have a reaction.  The center can give any of the 3 vaccines, based upon availability. If moderna or pfizer they automatically set up the 2nd appointment."
"Received first dose of Moderna vaccine. Much thanks to everyone at Gwinnett Health Department for making it as quick, easy, and painless as possible.  #vaccine #getthevaccine #gwinnettcountyhealthdepartment https://instagram.com/p/CMmwLW6BvA1/?igshid=q6c9pykiq6jh…"
Absolutely not! COVID-19 vaccines have not been approved by the FDA nor the CDC. They only granted authorized emergency use. Which ones will the airlines authorized? J&J is not as effective as Pfeifer or Moderna & u can still get COVID19 as none r 100%.
"Check the schedule, he’s getting a 30K shipment from Moderna plus 30K from Pfizer this WEEK. More than this week and more than the first week of April. It’s a lie. It has been steady &increasing.’Week worth delayed’? You’re even blowing up Moe’s lie, he said 30% of 1 vaccine."
"What logistics? There were none. He handled vaccine distribution the same way he “handled” the pandemic. It was the Hunger Games all over again. No federal response. He declined ordering vaccine for God’s sake. As to the vaccine, no fed $ was used for Pfizer or Moderna."
What is your opinion on this Pharma trade of COVID-19 vaccine. A great opportunity to make billions by fleecing billions.  @pfizer @pfizer_news @BioNTech_Group @AstraZeneca @SinovacVaccine @moderna_tx  (1/3)
How effective is the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine? https://news.yahoo.com/effective-first-shot-pfizer-moderna-112936910.html?soc_src=social-sh&soc_trk=tw&tsrc=twtr… via @YahooNews
I got my first dose of the moderna vaccine and legit got happy tears in my eyes. This past year has felt like a monster looming over my shoulder just waiting to catch up to me and now I'm finally gathering some defense.
I suspect Pfizer and Moderna are already developing 2nd generation vaccines with mRNAs encoding multiple Covid variants.  Booster shots in our future.
I have no idea what type of vaccine is available. I have to guess it's still predominantly Moderna/Pfizer tho.
"Is there a study of the dangers of covid for kids?  Since Moderna is now testing a vaccine for kids, I guess it must be pretty serious. But the public discussion about reopening schools seems to completely ignore the risks of covid infection on kids."
Not me calling it “the Dolly Parton vaccine” instead of just saying I got Moderna
i tried to get them to give me every single vaccine all at once but they only gave me one dose of just mommy moderna 
"The drug company Moderna has begun a study that will test its COVID vaccine in children younger than 12, including babies as young as 6 months. From the New York Times:"
"I get it, we should absolutely take any vaccine available. But also, I want Moderna."
Moderna Vaccine kicking my ass harder than crack in the 80s
First round of the Moderna Vaccine yesterday.  Only thing I've notice is my home wifi is real sporty this morning.....
"Husband got his second shot of #modernavaccine yesterday. Happy to report that he has absolutely zero side effects, except for a mildly sore arm."
#Covid19 A small study in pregnant and lactating women demonstrated that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were safe and led to a strong immune response in these patients. Click the link below to read the full update #vaccine #sideeffects #pfizer #moderna

"My aunt in San Diego had her appointment for her 2nd COVID vaccine shot canceled by Albertsons and now she can't find an appointment anywhere, at least not for another Moderna one."
"Dying to get back to those BMO nights. Moderna vaccine this morning Easy as chugging a beer before kickoff, just as quick too! If you want to see @JozyAltidore, @Chris_Mavinga, @justmorrow, @QuentinWestberg etc. sooner than later, do your part and get yours when its your turn!"

"Try CVS, Winn Dixie, & Walmart. They go by CDC mandates, not DeSantis. If you don't mind a drive, try Quincy, FL. I (59) and my son (25), both got Moderna vaccines this week. They don't ask for ID/ paperwork. They thanked us; they've had appts. not filled, or people not showing."
"La blague. Ne pas oubliez que les vaccins sont en phase 3 donc les vaccinés sont des cobayes. Moderna a admis que son vaccin modifie l’ADN, en violation de la convention d’Ovideo. "
"4/ The reality is that those efficacy numbers are not describing the same thing – and there’s still a lot that’s not known. It is fair to say the Moderna, Pfizer and J&J vaccines all performed very well in clinical trials."
"Yo. I'm vaccinated. Round 1, in the books. Let's make it happen. Keeping it safe. Doing this for ALL of us.  #vaccinated #vaccine #vaccinationssavelives #moderna #modernavaccine #fuckcovid"
These are not vaccines.   These are MRNA gene threapies. Not safe!    @moderna_tx tried for 10 years but the trails were unsuccessful on animals. But covid helped them pass these killer treatments.   They will blame Trump for operation warp speed even though the pharmaceutical
Got my 1st shot of the Moderna vaccine today and have the 2nd shot scheduled. Proud to be part of the 100 million shots goal that will be reached today. Thanks you @POTUS Biden  and @VP Harris!
"I got my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. So far, the only symptoms I feel is soreness on my arm. I hate needles in general so I felt that sucker."
if anyone cares this the reason the #OxfordAstraZeneca #vaccine has been subjected to so much negative lobbying by @moderna_tx @pfizer @JNJNews    fir these disgusting #US companies it is all about money  https://interc.pt/2P0YWz7 by @lhfang
This is what the first stage of relief looks like. 1st dose of vaccine is all up in me. #Moderna #covidvacccine

"Health experts have differing views over the benefits of giving more people their first shot and waiting a longer time to administer the second dose, or whether to stay the course and prioritize getting both doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine into arms as quickly as possible"
