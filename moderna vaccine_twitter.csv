I got called this week even though I'm not high risk and only 58. I'm getting mine now because others around me are not. My sister is high risk and turned down Moderna over a month ago. My company just sent out notice of $200 off next year's insurance if we get the vaccine.
He will have a story change. Hehehe they never run out of those changes. It will be how UG procured the wrong vaccine. It should've brought Moderna or Pfizer.
Any news on the #Moderna vaccine??
"The older vaccines were tested without the Brazilian or South African variants which were included with the JnJ testing. They’re testing Pfizer and Moderna against these now. In any case, all 3 protect the same against hospitalization or death so that’s the GOOD NEWS."
"That statement is patently false. Moderna vaccine was created Jan.13,2020, well before he even acknowledge a threat from the virus. Pfizer developed their's with no aid, support or guidance from the US government. And other countries had developed vaccines quicker."
"Got the Moderna vaccine today, then went to Trader Joe’s, came home & cleaned my bathroom. Get the shot."

Is Franklin aware that the vaccines used aborted fetal cells? Pfizer and Moderna were in the testing and J&J used them in the production. How does he justify that?
"Moderna has announced trials for children under 12, but a vaccine will still take time. Coming up at 6:40, Tim Sly from @RyersonU wades into the issue of what unvaccinated kids might safely do this summer."
You only have to wait a month. They are asking if in the past 28 days here. UM says it's ok. My MIL had the vaccine. She had COVID too. Who told you to wait? Which one did Julie get? David has his first AZ today. Alexa has first Moderna tomorrow! YAY!

24% of US under 18. Moderna/J&J not yet approved for under 18. Pfizer approved for 16 up. 25% of adults over 18 refuse to get vaccine So Somewhere between 45-50% of population of USA will NOT be getting vaccinated any time soon. No herd immunity in 2021

"Disagree Layla. Depends on the person. I've had do many adverse reaction to drugs, my Dr said I should get J&J as there's a possibility I'm allergic to PEG. The technology for Pfizer & Moderna hasn't been widely used until now. Personally, I trust old school style vaccine more."
I know vaccine appointments are available for pfizer and moderna. Are there any johnson & johnson vaccine appointments available in NY yet?
Do you know Anthony Fauchi owns Moderna? Reason enough to go for the J&J  real vaccine They’re not into eugenics or sterilization

Don't they know that everything Moderna did an animal trial on this type of vaccine it failed? #scary

Thank you President Trump for my first warp speed Moderna vaccine shot!! No one would have the opportunity to receive any vaccine if it was not for you! God bless!
Pfizer made it clear that the gov had no part in vaccine development. Moderna was working on corona virus family of vaccines prior to pandemic. Trump gets no credit for the work of others this time. Warp speed was a joke with a stupid name.

"Side effect update (I think): I'm having some discomfort around the front of my hips. I'm not sure it's connected, but read that over 40% of people who get the Moderna vaccine have muscle and joint pain. I wonder if it's lymph node related, given the location."
Great news. I got my second dose of the Moderna vaccine last Friday. I will be fully protected by the 26th. I am so grateful.
"Oh, I didn’t know trump is a scientist and/or a doctor. BTW, Moderna and Pfizer accepted ZERO US dollars to advance their research on the Covid-19 vaccines. So, yeah, there would be vaccines. Catch up with reality."

There are exports from EU region. Pfizer and Moderna are not manufacturing outside EU/US. AZ is manufacturing outside UK. Your comparing different production methods. AZ has been licensed outside the UK. UK hasn't blocked vaccine 'ingredients' made in UK to be exported to EU.

Indian govt has refused approval to Pfizer and not given approval yet to Moderna. Neither of those vaccines are coming to India in foreseeable future. Please stop inventing your own reality. 
"And, Moderna is facing production issues and is unable to fulfil contractual obligations to Canada and others. Your basic problem comes from not understand that Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA vaccines and have different production techniques to traditional vaccines."

More hints emerging that Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are also much less effective against the B.1.351 variant.  If this is true then the reopening narrative is going to hit a wall at some point in the coming months.

Why aren’t they getting the Moderna vaccine here? I read they were due to get it in March. Couldn’t that one take up the slack from the India shipment. Or are they just hesitant to pay higher prices for Moderna?

"I really WANT to get the #COVID19 vaccine, but probably never will because I'm dead last to get the vaccine. I'm too young, bipolar is not a good enough reason for underlying condition. Also I don't want to get the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines with bad effects, I want the Johnson one."
"Same for me with Moderna!!  Of course, I couldn't dunk before the vaccine."
