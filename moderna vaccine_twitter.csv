Which vaccine there’s three of the in the US. The peer reviewed study broke down @DrEricDing says moderna and Phizer are poor
"When you're having some (pretty mild) side effects to the Moderna vaccine, Pedro Pascal as Agent Marcus Pike is a nice pick-me-up. "
"Oh and by the way, both my mom and I successfully received our first Moderna vaccine shots today with slight arm soreness, nothing more. We are feeling euphoric."
Great!  I got my first dose of the Moderna vaccine today!!!
2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine
sell vaccines to them? are we private producers like pfizer moderna J&J?  what are you talking about  the peace agreements were conducted behind the scenes years before the covid and signed before the vaccines were made
"My understanding is that the J&J vaccine has the same operative principle of delivering mRNA for the endogenous production of spike protein like Moderna and Pfizer, but uses a modified adenovirus instead of a lipid bubble. So it shouldn't surprise me if reactions were the same."
"Thanks — so far, so good. We’ve been pretty strict for the past 12 months and just got our first round of the Moderna vaccine last week. My grandpa was a MD and grandma was a RN. They would have so much respect for you and your colleagues, as my family and I do. @_EricCarr"

"Every time I hear he failed, the same people tell me he didn't order vaccines until late (ordered Moderna before the US, and 7 different ones before the end of November), or bring up a Chinese vaccine that had no effect on other orders.   He's not perfect, but I don't get that."
"Got my second Moderna shot 3/16 - felt like crap for two days, but it wasn't I surprised.  I feel like crap for 1.5 days after a flu vaccine.  Both are worth it!"

"Homemade bread, grilled brats, broccoli with lemon-butter sauce. The rare meal containing not a single hot chile.  My immune system could stand to calm down a little after the second Moderna vaccine. Tomorrow, though, it’s back to spicy black-eyed pea soup and jalapeño cornbread."

I gratefully received my 2nd Moderna vaccine with no side effects on 3/1.  Friends advised me to: 1) Drink lots of water and take Tylenol or Ibuprofen from 2 days before & after. (I took Ibuprofen). 2) Eat something before and after getting the vaccine.
"you have to get 3 shots instead of 2! if u got moderna first and then pfizer, your 3rd shot has to be pfizer (that’s what they told me). this happens with any covid vaccine i think."

Got my first moderna vaccine!
New coat of paint on the old scarecrow who’s been staring back at me in the mirror w/dead eyes (and pandemic hair) all these months.  (So grateful my salon continues strict COVID safety protocols so I could take this Moderna vaccine for a VERY CAUTIOUS test drive.)
"That's not the one giving blood clots. There's no way in hell I'll have the one doing that as i have a blood clotting disorder. I've had clots before without doing anything wrong knowing i have factor V Leiden. I'm interested in the RNA vaccines, Pfizer or Moderna."
"Hmm. I'm wondering how it would be ""too much"" mRNA if getting the 2 full doses of the moderna is considered fine(28 days bt doses). Do you both mean too much mRNA in the sense that they received the moderna vaccine on the schedule of what's recommended for the Pfizer? 21 days?"
"Some people prefer the more traditional adenovirus vector that the J&J vaccine uses, as opposed to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna)."
An update on the #vaccinated hash.  48 hours in after  my first #modernavaccine and no soreness after shot #1.    Feeling perfect.  All Good.
Yeah... That's why I waited longer to take the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna one
"Moderna begins testing coronavirus vaccine in babies, children under 12"
Got first dose of Moderna vaccine. Next one April 1.
"actually it is. I got moderna vac and instead of going through our useless government , i did it through my doctor and she told me after i get 1st dose to not take covid tests because i will be positive because of something thats in the vaccine. so in essence more vacs=more cases"

I used to work at a gene therapy company. The mRNA Covid vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) are NOT gene therapy.   I also used to work at a vaccine company. These ARE vaccines and they do give you immunity to Covid.
What is the rate of effectiveness with only one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine?
Good job! Mums and dads need the support after Jabs. I snuggled my Jessie for awhile after my second Moderna jab. Jessie gets me. The vaccines are necessary!
Moderna begins testing COVID-19 vaccine for children
See my pinned tweet. I'm boycotting the horrible @moderna_tx practices and no pharmacy around me offers another vaccine.
"Moderna, NIAID vaccine- side effects may include swelling, redness, haphazardly conceiving a child with a girl you locked eyes with at your first Denny's visit in 18 months and pain at injection site."
"Had both Moderna vaccines. Hit my ""fully vaccinated"" mark on Wednesday!"
My arm sore af #modernavaccine
Got my first vaccine (Moderna) on the 11th.
My parents and grandma were find after their second Pfizer vaccines. My brother and I both had pretty bad symptoms after our second Moderna shots.
Yes both moderna vaccine no worries.
"... and the phishing emails about ""winning a Pfizer/Moderna vaccine appointment"" have started."
"Yes, my second dose of Moderna vaccine  4 more days now  "
I think asking marginalised women to risk a few cases of cvst for the greater good is not a great ask :( . I agree we http://should.be offered pfizer or moderna. Vaccine tiering is an equity concern.
"There are currently three available COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. — by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. When it’s your turn to receive the vaccine, can you pick which one you get?"
"""It is the most capitalist / structurally racist thing [if] the vaccines available to you are SES-predictable"" esp knowing what we know about varying efficacies for AZ and J&J as compared to pfizer or moderna. Do not chalk up BIPOC concerns about this to vaccine hesitance."
I got Moderna as well.  Good for you on getting your vaccine. My son gets his first one Monday.
". Xi properly inoculated either Moderna or Pfizer !  Xi would say, their vaccines are of highest quality on Earth, & must be reserved for export to friendly nations ! .  These are their typical expert lies e.g.  opium grown as revolutionary opium   huge defeat as Long March ! ."
"Day 3 of 1st vaccine. Minor headache all day until late pm. Minor aches improving. Finally not feeling dehydrated. Arm soreness much better but Moderna arm popped up, large red patch that’s hot to touch."
That moderna vaccine is whooping my ass Rn
I am eligible for the Pfizer vaccine but I can't get an appointment. Can't figure out how to get on the Moderna list. The website in Georgia is so confusing and the two list thing is BS.
Operation Warp Speed had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with the development of ANY COVID VACCINES. Not Pfizer’s. Not Moderna’s. Not Johnson & Johnson’s. Democrats delayed no PPP funding. Trump sabotaged our response at every step and killed countless Americans. You are a disgrace.
"There really isn’t a difference between Pfizer and Moderna.  I got my first Moderna last Monday, I would have preferred J&J to get it over in one shot, but wanted to start the vaccine process as soon as I could find a vaccine."
Hooray! Just got scheduled for the Moderna vaccine this Friday at Walgreens.
the @moderna_tx CEO should be dragged down the Washington Mall in a walk of shame for his corporate raiding and encouragement of more lethal variations. The vaccine is owned by US citizens and should be manufactured widely because it works...
Ang MRNA vaccines na bagong tech tulad ng Moderna at Pfizer uutusan lang ang katawan na gumawa ng harmless clones ng SarsCov2 para mag ready na ng antibodies na specific sa  virus na ito.  Mga old tech vaccines tulad ng Sputnik at Sinovac ay virus talaga pero harmless
"I got my moderna vaccine at the stadium today, after a 2 hour wait. Might wanna check your sources"

"My 86-y-old mother got the J&J vaccine; my husband has gotten his 1st dose of Moderna, and I got my 1st dose of Pfizer—we’re all ecstatic!"
he contracted w Moderna before he found out by his advisors how severe it was what does that tell you  he even said he would take a vaccine from China when asked. The same country he said brought covid tell me this when you can't go to doctor w\o vaccine.
So excited to get my moderna vaccine this week. Also SUPER excited to learn that only the  moderna vaccine affects facial fillers 
What does this even mean? The Pfizer Biontech vaccine uses mRNA technology that has been around for a decade. They took no US development funds. Moderna is also mRNA based while J&J is based on adenovirus.
"Oh and on top of that, I got an email my vaccine was cancelled because AHS cancelled the shipment of Moderna to the pharmacy I was scheduled to get it at"
I think I have a reaction to the moderna vaccine I got on the 15th. I have a red rash at my elbow and part way down my forearm and on the underside of my elbow. It's hot to the touch. It's only only on the arm I had the vaccine in.

"The plant being built is for Novavax. 3Q 2022. There is no possibility of producing an mRNA vaccine in Canada, and, in fact, the Pfizer and Moderna supply chains for *US based* production involve EU sourced components. Have a look at @Dereklowe 's excellent blog posts on this."
"Very slow speed of vaccination , looking like @MoHFW_INDIA not taking this seriously , ministry should allow @pfizer @moderna_tx vaccines."

Looks to be mostly Pfizer and Moderna. You might get lucky though.
"Journal, Johns Hopkins, and the Mayo Clinic for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The most interesting thing is that the PLACEBO groups in each of those trials tended to report a slightly to significantly higher number of side effects than the vaccine group."
"For the sake of clarity, the vaccines should be referred to as a Pfizer & Pfizer, a Moderna & Moderna, or a Johnson."
